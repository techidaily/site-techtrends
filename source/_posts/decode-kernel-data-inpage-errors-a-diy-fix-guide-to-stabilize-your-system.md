## Decode Kernel Data Inpage Errors: A DIY Fix Guide to Stabilize Your System
 The kernel data inpage error is a Windows error code displayed on the[Blue Screen of Death](https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-of-death-bsod-2625816) (BSOD). Your computer will typically compile some diagnostic data and then restart when this error occurs. If the problem persists, your computer will eventually crash again with the same kernel data inpage error message.

 Kernel data inpage errors are usually associated with hardware failures related to[memory modules](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drives](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) . In other cases, this same error will appear due to the effects of a virus.

## How to Fix a Kernel Data Inpage Error

 Since most kernel data inpage errors are because of bad memory modules or hard drives, the fix usually involves locating the malfunctioning component and replacing it.

 Computers that experience this problem will typically restart after crashing. If your computer won't turn on or boot up after experiencing a kernel data inpage error, check out our[guide to fixing a computer that won't turn on](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-computer-that-wont-turn-on-2624450) .

 In other cases, you'll find that a memory module or hard drive isn't correctly connected, or a virus caused the entire problem. Follow these troubleshooting steps to fix your kernel data inpage error:

[Back up your data](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-back-up-your-data-2640426) . If it's a problem with your hard drive, you could end up losing important data. If you have anything stored you don't want to lose, you should perform a backup before starting the diagnostic process. Make copies of any files you can't afford to lose, and store them on a[USB flash drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-flash-drive-2625794) , SD card, or cloud storage service.

1. Inspect and[reseat your memory modules](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reseat-a-desktop-memory-module-2624537) .  
 In some circumstances, the problem can be due to improperly seated memory modules. Open your computer and inspect your RAM to rule this out and prevent any unnecessary expenses. If any modules aren't correctly installed or have come loose, reseat them and check to see if the kernel data inpage error still occurs.  
 Exercise caution when opening a computer and adjusting components. Without a correctly set up anti-static bracelet, static electricity may permanently damage components like RAM.
2. Inspect and[reseat your hard drive cables](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reseat-internal-data-and-power-cables-2624536) .  
 This error usually indicates that the drive has physical defects like bad[sectors](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sector-2626003) . In some cases, you may experience this problem due to an improperly seated hard drive cable.  
 Open your computer, locate your hard drive, and reseat the connector cable to rule this possibility out. You'll also need to check and reseat the cable where it connects to your[motherboard](https://www.lifewire.com/motherboards-system-boards-and-mainboards-2618154) .  
 When your hard drive is running, listen carefully for any loud clicking noises. If you hear them, your hard drive may be in the process of failing, which can cause this type of error. The fix is to back up all your data and[replace your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) .
3. Test your memory.  
 Windows 10 has a built-in memory diagnostic tool. Free options are available for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10\. If you have Windows 10, type "**memory** " into the taskbar search field, then select**Windows Memory Diagnostic** \>**Restart now and check for problems** .  
 The[best free memory diagnostic tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) is[MemTest 86](https://www.lifewire.com/memtest86-review-2626145) , which you can download and use to check your RAM.  
 You may want to run more than one memory diagnostic tool. If any of these tools report a problem with your memory, consider[replacing your RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) . Doing so will probably fix your kernel data inpage error, but your RAM is likely to fail in the future either way if one of these tools finds a problem.
4. Use a program to test your hard drive.  
 You can check for problems with your hard drive using the built-in[Windows error-checking tool](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-scan-a-hard-drive-using-error-checking-2624497) or the[chkdsk command](https://www.lifewire.com/chkdsk-command-2625838) .  
 If your diagnostic tool of choice finds any problems, like bad sectors, allow it to attempt a fix. If successful, you should be able to use your computer without any further kernel data inpage error crashes.

5. Unplug [hardware peripherals](https://www.lifewire.com/peripheral-device-2625951) .  
 While less likely, this error can occur due to other peripherals. To rule this out, shut down your computer, unplug all of your hardware peripherals, and turn your computer back on.  
 If your computer doesn't crash with the kernel data inpage error, reconnect each device one at a time. When you find the device causing the problem, you can either leave it unplugged or replace it.
6. [Run a virus scan](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) .  
 In some cases, a virus may corrupt important files and cause a kernel data inpage error. It's less likely than other possibilities, but it's still important to check. If nothing else has worked, try running a virus scan. If any of these programs locate a virus, allow it to fix the problem, then check to see if you are still experiencing kernel data inpage errors.  
 We maintain a large[list of free antivirus software](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-antivirus-software-4151895) you can use to check for this type of problem.
