## 13-inch MacBook Pro With M2 Chip

 The[M2 MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/apples-m2-macbook-pro-isnt-the-successor-it-should-be-5496651) is identical to the 13-inch M1 model in every way except for the chip. It even includes a Touch Bar and a headphone jack. The M2 model can be upgraded with more memory and storage, but aside from faster processing, the M1 and M2 models are the same out of the box.

* **Chip** : Apple M2, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
* **Memory** : Up to 24GB of unified memory
* **Storage** : Up to 2TB SSD
* **Battery** : Up to 20 hours
* **Display** : 13.3-inch Retina display with True Tone technology
* **Ports and charging** : Two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports
* **Sensors** : Touch ID and Touch Bar, Force Touch trackpad
