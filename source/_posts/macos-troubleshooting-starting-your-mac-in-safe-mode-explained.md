## 13-inch MacBook Pro With M2 Chip

 The[M2 MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/apples-m2-macbook-pro-isnt-the-successor-it-should-be-5496651) is identical to the 13-inch M1 model in every way except for the chip.

* **Display** : 13.3-inch Retina display with True Tone technology
* **Ports and charging** : Two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports
* **Sensors** : Touch ID and Touch Bar, Force Touch trackpad
