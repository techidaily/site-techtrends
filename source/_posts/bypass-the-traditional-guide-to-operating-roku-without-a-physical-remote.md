Close 

###  What to Know

* Download the**Roku app** from Google Play or the iOS App Store.
* Tap the**Remote** icon. Select**Devices** and choose your TV from the list that appears.
* Use the remote interface on your phone as your remote control to change the volume or turn the television on and off.

  
 This article will tell you how to use the official Roku app to control a Roku TV without using the standard remote. Instructions apply to all Roku devices and phones running either iOS or Android.

##  How to Use Your Roku TV Without the Remote 

 All Roku devices use the same operating systems and remote, and owners can control them all with a smartphone app.

1. Download**The Roku App (Official)** on your smart device. It's available in the Apple App Store and Google Play.  
###  Important  
 Various third-party apps promote themselves as Roku remote controls. While some might be fine, we recommend the official Roku application.
2. At the bottom of the app, you will see the**Remote** option and the**Devices** option. First, select**Devices** .
3. Tap**Connect Now** , and then verify if it prompts you.
4. Under**Available on this network** , look for the name of your Roku device or Roku TV and select**Connect device** .  
 If you don't see your device, make sure it and your phone or tablet are[ connected to the same Wi-Fi network](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-roku-to-wifi-4174681) .

5. Once you've selected your Roku TV or device, return to the main screen and select**Remote** .
6. Along the top of the Remote tab, you'll find options to search, dictate, pull up a keyboard, and open settings.  
 The next row lets you return to a previous screen, open the guide, and return to the home screen.
7. Below these options, you'll see a navigation pad with an "OK" button in the center; this is your main way to get around menus.  
 The bottom section includes controls like play/pause, fast forward, rewind, and volume controls.
