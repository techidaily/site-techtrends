## Find Your Inbox Efficiency: Discover Faster Email Recovery with Outlook and Copernic's Lightning-Quick Search

You’re furiously searching every nook and cranny of your Outlook inbox to find that one email you need. It seems to have evaporated into thin air. This is an all-too-common scenario that you can probably relate to. Despite technological advancements, email is still one of the most widely used communication tools, especially within businesses and organizations. [A recent study shows](https://www.statista.com/topics/4295/e-mail-usage-in-the-united-states/#editorsPicks) there are over 4 billion email users worldwide, with more than 3 billion emails sent and received each day. These numbers come as no surprise since the average person sends and receives [over 100 emails daily](https://financesonline.com/email-statistics/) .

 How are you supposed to sort through hundreds, if not thousands, of emails to find a specific message or attachment? It is a daunting task, and with only basic tools such as Outlook Search, that email may be lost forever. The good news is that Copernic Search is designed specifically to find even the hardest files in seconds. Let’s take a closer look at the challenges of finding emails and how Copernic Desktop and Business Server Search can save the day.

**Why Can’t You Find That Email with Outlook Search?**

 You would think that you could find any email in Outlook with its native search function. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and the reason is that Outlook search is a basic tool with severely limited functionality. Here are the most common issues with Outlook search that can make it impossible to track down an email that you know exists.

* **Basic search functions** \- Outlook search does not offer advanced search and refinement options. This means you must use generic keywords, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. The inability to refine and filter your search can be incredibly frustrating when sifting through thousands of emails.
* **Limited scope**  – Outlook search can only access data within Outlook. This means it cannot search on your computer or network drives. It can’t even access shared emails without proper credentials, which can be cumbersome.
* **No search history** \- You cannot revisit or save old search queries for later. Each time you begin a search, you must start from the beginning.
* **Corruption** \- Due to the high volume of data, Outlook’s indexing can corrupt. This means that even if you are typing in the correct keywords, the email or attachment is not indexed correctly, so it will not appear in the search results.
* **Misplacing files** \- When dealing with high volumes of data, it can be easy to forget where an attachment is. For example, maybe you thought it was in your Outlook, but it was on the company’s server.

**Repercussions of Not Being Able to Find Emails**

 Not being able to find emails is more than just an aggravation. Lost emails affect workflow in the following ways:

* Costs valuable time that is better used on other tasks
* Results in duplication when the same information must be sent more than once
* Valuable information may not be recovered that is pertinent to a project
* Decreases efficiency when you must waste time searching for emails and attachments

**Copernic is the Email Tracker You Need**

 Searching for emails should not be the most notable part of your day. You need a [solution that is fast, accurate, and secure](https://tools.techidaily.com/) . Copernic search is all of these and more. Introducing cutting-edge software that is specifically designed to find files on your desktop, the cloud, and company servers.

**Two Versions of Copernic Search to Fit Your Needs**

 Copernic search is available in two versions, depending on your needs. The first is the Desktop & Cloud Search, which is ideal for individuals or small businesses that need to maximize efficiency. The second version is Copernic’s Business Server Search. This is a great option for medium to large businesses that store data over large servers that are accessed by multiple teams and departments.
