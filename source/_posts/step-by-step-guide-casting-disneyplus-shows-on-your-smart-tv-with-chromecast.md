## How to Enable a New Mail Sound for Gmail

 If you want to hear a new email sound when you use Gmail in your desktop web browser, you can make that happen—just not in Gmail itself.

 Since Gmail doesn't support pushing sound notifications through a web browser, you must install a third-party program like[Notifier for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-gmail/dcjichoefijpinlfnjghokpkojhlhkgl?hl=en) (a Chrome extension).

 If you're using the Notifier for Gmail Chrome extension:

1. Select**Extensions** next to Chrome's navigation bar, then select**More actions** (three vertical dots) and choose **Options** .

## How to Enable a Pop-Up Notification

 You can set Gmail to display a pop-up notification when new email messages arrive in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari when you are signed in to Gmail and have it open in the browser. Just turn on that setting in Gmail by selecting the **Settings**  icon then choosing **See all settings** and going to **General** \> **Desktop Notifications** . The notification is not accompanied by a sound.
