## MacBook Pro Keyboard Woes? Here’s How to Bring It Back to Life
 When a MacBook Pro keyboard stops working, you may find none of the keys work at all, or some keys work. If the[Touch Bar](https://www.lifewire.com/apples-touch-bar-idea-was-cool-but-didnt-work-out-5209079) doesn't work, a software issue is likely the cause.

 You'll need to attempt fixes such as cleaning it, checking for updates, and removing potential problem apps to get your keyboard working again. Most of these fixes also work for MacBook Air keyboards.

 Apple's butterfly keyboards were such a problem; Apple had to issue a[Keyboard Service Program for the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks) .

## How to Fix a MacBook Pro Keyboard That Isn't Working

 If your keyboard stops working, the first step is to clean it. If that doesn’t work, you need to connect a spare keyboard and try a handful of other fixes.

 In a worst-case scenario, contact Apple for professional assistance. Don’t attempt any advanced repairs or disassembly yourself, as Apple fixes some of these problems at no charge.

 Some of these fixes require a working keyboard. If you don't have a spare keyboard, borrow one. If you connect a second keyboard and it doesn't work either, your Mac probably needs a professional repair.

 Here’s how to fix a MacBook Pro keyboard that has stopped working:

1. [Clean the keyboard](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-macbook-keyboard-4179083) . Dust and other debris represent the most common cause of malfunctioning MacBook keyboards, so start by cleaning your keyboard to the best of your ability with compressed air.  
 If you see any visible debris on the keyboard at this point, use a vacuum with a soft-bristled attachment to finish cleaning.
2. Plug in the MacBook. If your battery is low, the keyboard may not work, and you may not see a low battery alert. Wait for the MacBook to charge and then check to see if the keyboard works.
3. [Check for updates](https://www.lifewire.com/update-macos-macbook-pro-4178508) . Connect a USB or wireless keyboard and perform the standard procedure of checking for updates. If your MacBook needs any driver or operating system updates, update them, and then see if the keyboard works.
4. [Remove recent apps](https://www.lifewire.com/uninstall-apps-on-mac-4159740) . If you installed one or more apps right before this problem started, it might be causing a conflict. Uninstall any apps you recently installed, restart your MacBook, and then check to see if the keyboard works.
5. [Restart the Touch Bar using terminal](https://www.lifewire.com/mac-terminal-commands-4774997) . Open terminal and type**sudo pkill TouchBarServer;** \> press**enter** \> type**sudo killall “ControlStrip”;** \> press**enter** . Enter your password and press**enter** .  
 If the Touch Bar is the part of your MacBook Pro keyboard that isn’t working, you can usually use the terminal to get it working again.
6. Turn off Slow Keys. If this function is on, you have to hold down each key longer than usual before it registers. That can make it seem like the keyboard doesn’t work at all if you’re only pressing each key for a short amount of time.  
 Here’s how to turn it off: Select the**Apple menu** \>**System Settings** \>**Accessibility** \>**Keyboard** and make sure**Slow Keys** isn't on.  
 Depending on your operating system, you may need to follow this sequence to view the Slow Keys setting:**Apple menu** \>**System Preferences** \>**Accessibility** \>**Keyboard** \>**Hardware** .
7. Turn off Mouse Keys. This setting can cause problems if it’s accidentally turned on.  
 To turn off Mouse Keys, go to**System Settings** or**System Preferences** \>**Accessibility** \>**Pointer Control** \>**Alternate Control Methods** and make sure**Mouse Keys** isn’t on.
8. Check the keyboard layout setting. If you have the wrong keyboard layout set, the keys won’t function as expected.  
 Here’s how to check:**System Settings** or**Preferences** \>**Keyboard** \>**Input Sources** \>**Edit** \> select the correct keyboard layout for your region and language.  
 A shortcut for checking the input source is to show the Input menu in the Mac menu bar. It should be set to display by default, but you can check from**Keyboard** \>**Input Sources** \>**Edit** \>**Show Input menu in menu bar** .
9. [Reset the System Management Controller (SMC)](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-smc-system-management-controller-on-mac-2260840) . If there’s a problem with your MacBook’s SMC, it may result in the keyboard not working correctly. Resetting the SMC usually takes care of the problem.
10. [Seek professional help from Apple](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601) . If your keyboard still doesn’t work after you attempt all these fixes, or it’s just specific keys that don’t work, you need to get help from Apple.  
 Apple fixes some keyboard issues at no charge due to defects in the butterfly switch mechanisms, but customer support can tell you whether your MacBook is covered.

 Before you take your MacBook in for service, make sure to[back up the data on your Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/back-up-mac-to-external-hard-drive-with-time-machine-5069853) .
