**1\. Check Apple's System Status**

You'll experience issues if Apple Server is down. When iTunes store is unable to process purchases, go to [Apple's System Status page](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/), check the current status, and see whether there's an issue related to the iTunes store being reported officially here. If Apple's server is down currently, wait for a while and try again later. If no, try the next solution.

**2\. Check Your Payment**

If you have a pending amount related to iTunes, get it paid. As soon as you pay, you should have no problems with iTunes store anymore. Or try a different payment method. 

**3\. Update Your Account**

Some users ask Apple Support for help when running into iTunes not processing purchases issue. They are suggested to log out and log in with their accounts. This step is important particularly for those who changed Apple ID or password recently. Go to Settings > \[your photo\] > iTunes & App Store, tap your Apple ID, sign out, then Sign In with your account. 

**4\. Check Network Connection**

The message may occur due to the network side issue. First, make sure you have a stable Wifi network. Also, try to reset your Network Settings. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. Switch off your device, enable automatic app updates, turn Wifi on, then check if the issue is gone. Try a different Wifi network when the Wifi is not active. 

**5\. Set the Correct Date and Time**

This method does work for a few users and may be worth your time. Go to Settings > General > Date & Time on your iPhone iPad, set the correct date and time, or set it automatically on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Steps are a bit different on macOS, Apple TV, and PC. On Mac, head to System Preferences > Date & Time, for Apple TV, click Settings > General > Date and Time, and on PC, search for timedate.cpl. 

**6\. Restart Your Device**

Restart is a quick fix to various errors. It's easy to do a restart on your device but it works for some. After you've tried all the easy solutions, and the iTunes store could not purchase music or movies, or others, or download updates, just restart your devices.
