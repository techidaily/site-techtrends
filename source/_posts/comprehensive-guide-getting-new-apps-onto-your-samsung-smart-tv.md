### What to Know

* The pre-installed browser is the only one that's available. However, there are ways to connect a different browser.
* Use a media streaming device like Fire TV (Silk or Firefox) or Chromecast (Chrome).
* For a lot more web browser options, plug a laptop into the TV using an HDMI cable.

 This article explains how to use an alternative to[Samsung's Smart TV web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-smart-tv-web-browser-4686055) , which is preinstalled on your TV. While you can't install a new browser on the TV, you do have other options.

## Option One: Connect a Streaming Stick That Offers Another Browser

[Media streaming devices](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-streaming-device-5208767) that have their own web browser is one workaround. Just plug the streaming stick into the TV and use its built-in browser, or download a different browser through its app store.

### Amazon Fire TV

 Amazon Fire TV offers both the Firefox and Silk web browsers, which provide more flexibility than the Samsung Smart TV browser. Silk (called**Internet** ) is built-in; select**Apps** from the home screen to find it. You'll need to download Firefox through the search icon in the upper left corner.

 One handy feature included in these browsers, in addition to using the navigation controls on the Fire TV remote, is that you can also use[Alexa commands](https://www.lifewire.com/most-secret-alexa-commands-4783117) to search the web. However, typical browser options, like saving passwords and downloading images, isn't available on the Fire TV version of Firefox. Also, Mozilla has stopped supporting Firefox on Fire TV, although it's still available for download.

### Google Chromecast

 If you're using Chrome on your computer, select**Cast** from the upper-right menu button to send anything visible on your screen to your Samsung TV. The Chromecast must be connected via HDMI to the back of the TV.

[Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/chromecast-to-tv-5323503)

![Cast Chrome from PC Setup](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e8ADuzfzBuQ8iLanvj8d5-UOWOc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/casting-from-pc-activation-b-bad0e0455c6441558c64ec7e41d514e1.jpg)

 If you open a new tab, or close the existing one, you'll need to cast the new tab in order to see it on the big screen.

### Apple TV

 Apple TV doesn't offer a web browser that can be installed directly to the device, but you can get[AirWeb](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airweb-web-browser-for-apple-tv/id770893993) on your iPhone or iPad. Using[AirPlay](https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-airplay-work-and-what-devices-can-use-it-2438219) , you can mirror the AirWeb browser through the Apple TV connected to your Samsung TV. You can also[AirPlay your Mac's screen](https://www.lifewire.com/airplay-from-mac-to-tv-5191732) to a connected Apple TV device.

### Why a Plug-in Media Streamer May Not Be the Best Option

 Unless you already have an external media streamer, it may not be the best option for getting a web browser on your Samsung TV. This is because you're paying for a device that provides duplicate access to a lot of the same streaming apps that your Samsung TV may already offer.

 If you're satisfied with the app selection on your Samsung TV, using another method to get an alternative web browser to work with your TV might be more efficient. One such option is to plug a computer directly into your TV.  

## Option Two: Plug a PC Into Your TV

 The next best option is to plug your computer into your TV. This will put whatever is on your computer directly onto your TV. This includes any web browser that can run on your PC, plus software programs and even the entire desktop. You'll be able to use your keyboard and mouse and transmit audio over the cable.

 To do this, simply use an HDMI cable to attach the computer and TV to each other. Learn more in our guide:[How to Connect a Laptop to a TV via HDMI](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-laptop-to-tv-via-hdmi-5081384) (it's the same for desktops).

## Option Three: Use Screen Mirroring

 Wireless screen mirroring is available on most Wi-Fi-enabled PCs, laptops, and smartphones. Screen mirroring allows you to transmit any browsers, as well as everything else displayed or stored on your PC or smartphone, to your Samsung TV screen. See[How to Mirror a Laptop to a TV](https://www.lifewire.com/mirror-laptop-to-tv-5072966) for help.

 To mirror your Samsung phone's screen to your TV, swipe down from the top of the screen and tap**Smart View** ,**Quick Connect** , or**Screen Mirroring** . The phone will look for the TV, usually identifying it by the model number. When the model appears, select it. You may be asked to enter a PIN provided by the TV.

 Other devices might call this**Screen Share** ,**Wi-Fi Direct** , or**Miracast** . Search the Settings app for these options.

 Screen mirroring is supported on almost all Samsung Smart TVs. If you don't see your TV in the list, you might need to turn on mirroring manually. Setup varies, so consult your TV's user guide or online manual for the exact steps for your model. Here are some things you can try:

* Press the**Source** button on your remote, then select the**Screen Mirroring** option on the TV menu.
* Select**Menu** on your remote, then go to**Network** \>**Screen Mirroring** .
