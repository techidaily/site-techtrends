_"I found at Beachbody/P90X site that many users were unable to play Beachbody DVDs, just like me. When I put in the DVD, I hear a sort of a whirling sound, like it's trying to spin and pick up steam but then stops. I also hear another sound, like a little clatter or something. It shows Drive E but no title. I get a message from VLC that it cannot play the Beachbody workout DVD and I should check the log, but I'm unsure where that might be." -- Posted by MMS at The VideoLAN Forums_
