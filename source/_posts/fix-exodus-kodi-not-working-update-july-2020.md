 Kindly note that the Exodus addon no longer works in Kodi, and neither its related repositories. But don’t worry. The alternative working add-on to Exodus is Exodus Redux. And in this post you’ll learn how to install Exodus redux on Kodi step by step.

## **Things to know before getting started**

### 1\. Notifications before using Exodus on Kodi

 Before getting started, kindly note that neither Driver Easy nor Kodi encourages the piracy. You should use Kodi and its add-ons legally.

 Is Exodus Kodi add-on legal? Kodi features several open APIs to enable third-party developers to create add-ons. Any third-party Kodi add-on is an illegal add-on, including Exodus. However, Exodus claims that it only hosts the links and sources for the videos, instead of the media content. Therefore, we should use Exodus and Kodi legally.

### 2\. Configure settings before installing Exodus on Kodi

 Sometimes the add-ons you are installing come from unknown developers, and Kodi restricts downloading add-ons and watching videos from unknown sources. So before installing Exodus, you’ll need to set up allowing unknown sources in your Kodi.

 1) Open Kodi, click **Settings** \> **System settings** .

 2) Click **Add-ons** , and tap the button next to **Unknown sources** , then click **Yes** to confirm.

 3) Then you can install add-ons like Exodus in your Kodi to improve your experience.

### 3\. Get a VPN to use Kodi

 It’s recommended to use a VPN when using Kodi and streaming videos.

 To prevent any possible problems like Exodus add-on not working, you should install a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN will mask the video, so your ISP won’t recognize it as a Kodi video and, as a result, won’t block it.

 To find a VPN, just search VPN in your browser, then pick the one with the best reputation. If you don’t have time or patience, you can try[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 NordVPN helps you bypass geo-restrictions to get all add-ons desired, keeps you protected from snooping eyes, and secures your data to keep your online activity private. It’s safe and easy to use!

 Click **[NordVPN coupon](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to get NordVPN coupon code first, then follow the steps below to download and use NordVPN.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) NordVPN in your device. You can get _**75% OFF**_ .
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.
