Hillman Grad Productions

**IMDb Rating** : 7.2/10

**Genre** : Comedy, Drama

**Starring** : Radha Blank, Peter Kim, Oswin Benjamin

**Director** : Radha Blank

**Motion Picture Rating** : R

**Runtime** : 2 hours, 3 minutes

 Based on playwright Radha Blank's real-life career struggles, this semi-autobiographical film follows the main character's attempt to reinvent herself as a hip-hop artist. In music, she finds relief from feeling that she's sacrificing too much of her authentic voice to gain recognition in New York City's theater world.

 If you need a reminder that success doesn't always have a set path or fall by a certain age, this is a cathartic and humorous homage to staying true to oneself.
