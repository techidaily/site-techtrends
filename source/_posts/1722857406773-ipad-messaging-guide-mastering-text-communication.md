 Printable sign language charts are good for instant reference. Put a few in your pocket, place them around the house, or spend some time memorizing them to learn offline.

* [Start ASL's free sign language chart](https://www.startasl.com/free-sign-language-chart/) : This resource provides images of comon words like "what," "how," "hungry," "bathroom," "woman," and "food" being signed. Instructions for how to sign are below most of them.
* [Lifeprint's alphabet fingerspelling](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/wallpaper1.htm) : Print these two sets of pictures to learn the alphabet. Both sets have the letters on the hands, but they also have a version without the letters for practice.
* [These numbers/common words/letters](https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/language-language-arts/learning-languages/american-sign-language/signing-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-208315/) : This cheatsheet is similar to the other printables here with four images you can print for keywords, such as "how," "which," "where," "yes," "please," "thanks," "goodbye," etc. There are also printables for the alphabet and numbers one through 10.
* [Print individual letters in sign language](https://www.teachersprintables.net/category/sign%5Flanguage) : These printables includes large letters of the alphabet represented in sign language. One way to use these is to print them off and place them next to objects that start with that letter for passive learning.

## Online Sign Language Games

![Deafsign sign language game](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IQalTEok0f9rsq2T7BbkUjCQIPE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/deafsign-game-aa058ef7a9864e928cc4f1e12053e33a.png)

 Online games can make learning sign language fun. If you've completed a few courses or spent some time with a sign language app or worksheet, play a game to test what you've learned.

* [Sporcle's Sign Language Live: Colors](https://www.sporcle.com/games/THEJMAN/asl-colors) : This game tests whether you can name all 18 colors before the 15-minute timer is up.
* [Choose the Sign](https://www.deafsign.com/ds/index.cfm?scn=games) : These puzzles give you random signs, and you must select the right answer from the ones given. There are also four tests with similar questions available through that link.
* [What's the Number?](http://asl.bz/) : This game signs a number to you and you must provide the correct answer. You can adjust the amount of time the sign remains on the screen, and you can play with numbers from zero through nearly a billion!
