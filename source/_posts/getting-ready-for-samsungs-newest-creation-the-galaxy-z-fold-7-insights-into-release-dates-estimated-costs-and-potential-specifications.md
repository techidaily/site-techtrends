## When Will Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Be Released?

 Samsung, unsurprisingly, comes out with a new phone every year. That simple fact, coupled with a few early rumors, has us confident that the Z Fold 7 is in the works. Since the company announces new phones at their Unpacked events, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 release date will fall in line with[next year's Samsung Unpacked event](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-unpacked-news-and-rumors-5093153) .

### Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

July or August 2025 is our best guess for now.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Price Rumors

 How much the Z Fold 7 will cost isn't something we can determine this far out. If we assume Samsung will stick with the same pricing as the Z Fold 6, it'll start at $1,899.99\. However, this year's phone is priced $100 higher than last year's, so we could be looking at a $2,000 phone next year.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Specs & Features

 We're still_very_ early, so there really isn't much in the way of leaks. All we've heard so far is that the next Galaxy Z Fold might have a larger screen and be slimmer and lighter.

 If this report from the Korea Economic Daily is accurate,[the next Z Fold could be as thin as Samsung's S series phones](https://www.kedglobal.com/electronics/newsView/ked202407180006) when folded. The report says Samsung engineers have been tasked with making the phone "similar to the bar-type Galaxy S24â€™s thickness of 7.7 millimeters."

 This sounds doable at a glance, considering the downward trend we've seen so far. The[first Galaxy Fold (from 2019) sits at 17.1mm](https://news.samsung.com/my/galaxy-history-%E2%91%A0-evolution-of-the-galaxy-z-fold-series-thinner-sturdier-and-compact-as-ever) and the latest model is just over 12mm thick. But this means that, when unfolded, the phone would be_half_ the thickness of the 8.6mm[Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-7964195) . Only time will tell if Samsung can manage this significant of a change in just over a year.

 The company is also reportedly trimming off some weight, but we don't know how much. Durability is the most obvious concern as a phone gets thinner and lighter, so it will be interesting to see how Samsung tackles this.

 Despite its slimmed-down profile, the Z Fold 7 might also manage to pack a bigger screen. Rumors say the foldable display could get as big as 8 inches (the Z Fold 6 is 7.6 inches).[The display might use blue phosphorescent OLED (aka PHOLED)](https://wccftech.com/galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-could-be-the-first-phones-to-use-blue-pholed/) instead of blue fluorescent, which[could ultimately reduce the size of the battery](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blue-pholed) , supporting the rumor of a thinner device.

 Given its purported release date, the Z Fold 7 will likely run the[Android 15](https://www.lifewire.com/android-15-7547471) \-based One UI 7 operating system. Leaker_Ice Universe_ claims that when compared to[all the other versions of One UI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405) , this one will be the most changed. We could see a huge overhaul to the UI, including new icons, menus, and animations, plus a[vertical app drawer](https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-7-vertical-app-drawer-hint/) .
