## How to Get Deleted Numbers Back on a Samsung Phone

 It's easy to recover deleted contacts on a Samsung phone because there's a handy recycle bin area that stores this information. You have 30 days to get a deleted phone number back before it disappears forever. Here's how:

2. From the**Recycle bin** section, tap**Contacts** .

1. Go to**Contacts** \>**Menu** \>**Manage Contacts.**
