## Beyond the Job Title:  
Meet the Music Lovers at ABBYY

July 12, 2024

At ABBYY, our colleagues are more than their job titles. They are passionate, well-rounded individuals whose passions outside of work make them stellar contributors to our success. We are excited to introduce a new content series, "Beyond the Job Title," where we delve into the lives of our team members and explore how their hobbies and passions enhance their work. In this first blog, we shine a spotlight on three ABBYY team members who share a deep love for music and explore, perhaps, surprising ways in which their passions enhance their work. Let's hear it from Nick, Collin, and Aaron.

#### Nick Carr, Director of EMEA Pre-Sales, UK

![Nick Carr Director of EMEA Pre-Sales UK](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/blog/beyond-the-job-title-meet-the-music-lovers-at-abbyy/nick-carr-director-of-emea-pre-sales-uk.jpg)

Nick Carr has been captivated by music from an early age, finding joy and challenge in mastering different instruments. His journey with the drums began as a teenager, and this passion has accompanied him throughout his life and career.

##### What drew you to music? When and why did you decide to give playing the drums a go?

"I was always interested in music from an early age (since I was five or six), it was something that I found interesting and gravitated towards," Nick Carr shares. Encouraged by his parents, Nick learned various instruments, including the violin, guitar, and piano, before switching to drums at 16\. "The drums were always something that fascinated me, even from that very early age." Self-taught for ten years, Nick's journey into drumming included watching concert DVDs of Queen and The Eagles, air drumming along, and eventually, joining bands.

##### What is special about this hobby to you?

Nick describes drumming as freeing and expressive, allowing him to create something unique with his own style. "There is always something to learn and improve upon, which is really rewarding once you overcome those challenges," he notes.

##### Do you feel like having this specific hobby helps you achieve a better work-life balance?

Nick finds that playing music provides the perfect mental recharge. "My normal work can be quite analytical, whereas with music, it's expressive and completely the opposite, which is perfect for me to recharge mentally and have some fun."

##### Are there any skills you developed practicing this specific hobby that are transferrable to your work at ABBYY?

Nick told us how his passion helped him become more adaptable, and a better communicator and leader,

* **Adaptability**: " Playing a function gig, you need to be prepared to play the set list but also be able to adapt to the environment and improvise should something go wrong, or you want to extend a chorus and work with the crowd. This is a similar approach to what I take when presenting ABBYY products. Know what you want to present, but also know the products well enough that you can adapt to the situation and read the room. A client may throw out a question that takes us off down a tangent, we need to be adaptable to the situation and respond to that with the knowledge of our technologies to address the point or question.”
* **Communication**: Teaching drums to youngsters ages 6-12 honed his ability to adjust communication based on the audience's understanding, crucial for client presentations. “It’s the same when it comes to presenting information to clients, you need to be aware of the personas in the meeting and be able to break down complex topics into easy-to-understand language at different levels if the audience is non-technical.”, he told us.
* **Leadership**: " Being the drummer in a band you’re essentially leading from the back, you need to know what is going on, where we’re at in the song, what song is coming up next, and be that foundation that the band members can rely on," a role similar to leading his Pre-Sales team and ensuring alignment with clients' needs. “In client meetings, I lead from a technology standpoint, but I also need to be aware of the wider picture from the client’s perspective and how ABBYY can bring value to their business. Working concisely with my colleagues to understand the situation, the topics we need to present and our approach, being that foundation in the meeting.”

#### Colin Busick, Public Relations Specialist, US

![Colin Busick Public Relations Specialist US](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/blog/beyond-the-job-title-meet-the-music-lovers-at-abbyy/colin-busick-public-relations-specialist-us.jpg)

Colin’s musical journey began with childhood piano lessons, eventually leading him through a variety of musical ensembles and experiences. His dedication to music has deeply influenced his personal and professional life.

##### What made you choose this hobby? How did you come across this activity?

"My parents put me in piano lessons when I was young, which served as a gateway to participating in scholastic music ensembles," Colin Busick recalls. His musical journey spans various settings, from classical pieces to drum and bugle corps. "I chose to stick with it because there was always something to learn, practice, or be inspired by."

##### What is special about playing music for you?

Colin values the friendships and unique experiences music has brought into his life. "Sharing those experiences with others is the pinnacle of the human experience," he believes. “You don’t even need to speak the same language to share a profound moment with someone while playing music – sometimes a simple glance, an approving nod, or a contorted 'stank face' can convey more than words could ever hope to.” Music transcends language barriers, allowing profound connections through shared performances.

##### Are there any skills that you develop by playing music that you can use in your job at ABBYY?

“Plenty!” is Colin’s initial one-word answer, before he goes on and draws parallels between music and teamwork:

* **Knowing when to lead and when to support**: "Having these musical instincts is akin to being a good team player. You can’t always be steering the ensemble, but you can’t always hide in the background either. "
* **Improvisation**: Effective communication on the fly and adapting to unexpected situations. “At work or when making music, oftentimes, improvised ideas come from things you’ve heard or learned in the past – it’s okay to take inspiration, as long as you make it your own!”
* **Time management and accommodation**: Coordinating rehearsals and performances mirrors the logistical demands of ABBYY's global and remote structure: “Sometimes you have to wake up a little early, sometimes you have to stay a little late. Sometimes you have to have something ready by a certain time, because that’s what the group is focusing on at the next rehearsal. Thanks to music, the particularities of working in a global and remote structure like ABBYY’s come as no shock to me.”

#### Aaron Schafer, Senior Customer Success Manager, US

![Aaron Schafer Senior Customer Success Manager US](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/insights/blog/beyond-the-job-title-meet-the-music-lovers-at-abbyy/aaron-schafer-senior-customer-success-manager-us.png)

Aaron Schafer's love for DJing started in his youth, influenced by his father's work as a DJ. His passion for drum and bass music has shaped his life, providing a creative outlet and a sense of community.

##### What made you choose this hobby? How did you come across this activity?

"My father was a DJ for hire when I was young," Aaron Schafer says, sharing how his exposure to diverse music led him to DJing at 17\. Dissatisfied with hearing a local DJ's repetitive sets, Aaron was inspired to take over the booth, marking the start of his DJ journey.

##### What is special about being a DJ for you?

Aaron cherishes the drum and bass community, a niche genre he helps grow. "The drum and bass scene has a very unique community that I deeply cherish. It's a niche genre that has remained resilient despite not being very mainstream. As both a DJ and an organizer, I appreciate the opportunity to enrich this community, helping it grow and introducing new enthusiasts to a style of music that they might not have explored otherwise," he explains.

##### How does practicing DJing help you with your work-life balance?

DJing offers Aaron a creative outlet that balances his structured day job. "Organizing and performing at events keeps my schedule dynamic and exciting," he tells us, emphasizing the importance of this balance for his overall well-being.

##### Are there any skills that you develop practicing DJing that you can use in your job at ABBYY?

DJing has been transformative for Aaron. He told us how “coming from a background of shyness and a fear of rejection”, performing in front of diverse crowds has enhanced his ability to engage confidently with colleagues and clients and provided him with an invaluable avenue for creative release.

At ABBYY, our employees' passions outside of work play a significant role in their professional lives, bringing creativity, adaptability, and strong interpersonal skills to their roles. Their stories inspire us all to pursue our interests and find joy in the balance between work and play.
