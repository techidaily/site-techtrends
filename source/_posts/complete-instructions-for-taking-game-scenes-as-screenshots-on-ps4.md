## How to Update Your Discord Avatar

 The process for adding or updating your profile picture is the same in a browser and the app. You can also remove the image; Discord doesn't require one.

 Discord places limits on changing an avatar image. Users can make no more than two attempts within 10 minutes to prevent people from trying to circumvent Discord's terms of service.

1. Open the app on PC or Mac.
2. Click settings cog at the bottom left next to the current image.
