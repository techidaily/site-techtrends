## Is the Compact New Mac Mini with M4 Chipset a Match for Your Needs? Unveiling Its Capabilities

The M2 Mac Mini

Michael Gariffo/ZDNET

The second half of 2024 is shaping up to be a big product season for Apple. Along with the release of the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-upgrade-my-iphone-every-year-but-the-iphone-16-worries-me-heres-why/) and its much-touted [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/), Apple looks to be [adding the new M4 chips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-upcoming-m4-chips-bring-ai-to-its-entire-line-of-macs-heres-when-theyre-expected/) to all its new computers. If that's the case, it would be the first time Apple imbues its entire lineup of computers with the same processor simultaneously. 

**Also: [Will you pay for Apple Intelligence? Up to $20 a month is 'a real possibility'](https://www.zdnet.com/article/will-you-pay-for-apple-intelligence-up-to-20-a-month-is-a-real-possibility/)**

But more changes could be coming beyond the addition of new processors. Bloomberg's [Mark Gurman reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-08/mac-mini-m4-apple-plans-to-release-smallest-desktop-computer-yet) that "at least one Mac model... will get more dramatic changes." Although this could refer to a design shift of the MacBook Pro, it also likely refers to the [Mac Mini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-mac-mini-2023-review/).

Yes, Apple's smallest computer is getting even smaller. Surely a revamp is overdue, considering that the Mini hasn't seen a redesign since 2010\. Still, this expected redesign could reduce the already-diminutive computer to the size of an [Apple TV](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/apple-tv-4k-review-apple-is-finally-selling-more-for-less/) (less than four inches across) _and_ arm it with the M4 Apple Silicon chip.

Such a small but mighty new Mac Mini would make an interesting addition to the market. The new Mac Mini is said to be designed upward, measuring slightly taller than the current version, but with an overall smaller footprint. 

The new version would also skip over the M3 chip entirely in favor of Apple's newest processor. Gurman reports that developers working on the new Mac Mini called the device "an iPad Pro in a small box," connecting the dots between the two devices using the M4 chip currently in the new tablets.

The lack of a display keeps the price low -- the current Mini version with the M2 chip starts at $599 -- but it's unclear what the price point would be for the M4-powered Minis. With a redesign and significant power upgrade, the price will likely be bumped higher but remain much lower than a new MacBook. 

There will reportedly also be two new versions of the Mac Mini, one with a more basic configuration, and a higher-end, potentially "Pro" model with more memory.

The new Mac Minis will likely be launched at the end of 2024 alongside other devices with the M4 chip. But we'll have to wait and see what Apple announces at its upcoming event in September (potentially the 10th or the 17th). Besides news of the revamped line of computers, the company is expected to release details on the new iPhone 16, its new lineup of Apple Watches, and, of course, developments on its AI platform, [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/).
