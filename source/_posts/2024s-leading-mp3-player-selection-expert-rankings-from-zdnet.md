## Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra

### Best stylus tablet overall

**Display**: 14.6-inch, 120Hz, Super AMOLED 2,960 x 1,848 display | **Processor**: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 | **Storage**: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, microSD up to 1TB | **Memory**: 8GB, 12GB, 16GB | **Colors**: Graphite | **Cameras**: 13MP and 6MP rear. 12MP and 12MP ultrawide front camera | **Weight**: 1.6 lb | **Dimensions**: 12.85 x 8.21 x 0.22 inches | **Connections**: USB-C | **Battery:** 11,200mAh

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is the latest and greatest tablet from the Korean tech giant. Launched in February of this year, it caught the eyes of artists, designers, and S-Pen lovers, because -- frankly, it's a big tablet. With a 14.6-inch, 120Hz, Super AMOLED panel, the Tab S8 Ultra is arguably the largest tablet on the market (not counting 2-in-1s).

Besides providing an immersive entertainment experience, the 14.6-inch panel makes for an unbounded canvas, or at least it feels like it. Samsung's S Pen, which comes included with the tablet, now carries a 2.8ms latency. That means your inputs and strokes appear on the screen the moment the stylus touches it. The Tab S8 Ultra also carries some nifty S Pen tricks that play hand-in-hand with the software experience. Air Commands, for example, allows you to capture and edit screenshots by pressing the S Pen's hardware button. 

**Review:** [**ZDNET goes hands-on with the Tab S8 Ultra**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-series-gets-a-new-14-6-inch-ultra-flagship/)

On the spec front, the Tab S8 Ultra is as beefed up as any [flagship Android tablet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-tablet/) can get. Under the hood is Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, a quad-camera setup for video calls and 8K recording, and a massive 11,200mAh battery. 

It's not a compact tablet by any means, but for the same price as the [Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-vs-ipad-pro-12-9-inch/), the Tab S8 Ultra is the stylus tablet to buy if you favor a large screen.

## Apple iPad Pro

### Best stylus tablet running iPadOS

**Display**: 11-inch Retina or 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | **Processor**: Apple Silicon M2 | **Storage**: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | **Biometrics**: Face ID | **Colors**: Silver, space gray | **Cameras**: 12MP rear, 10MP ultrawide, 4K video. 12MP FaceTime ultrawide camera | **Weight**: 11-inch: 1.03 pounds; 12.9-inch: 1.5 pounds | **Dimensions**: 11-inch: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.23 inches, 12.9-inches: 11.04 x 8.46 x 0.25-inches| **Connections**: Thunderbolt/USB 4 port | **Battery life:** 10 hours

The latest iPad Pro is Apple's tried-and-true stylus tablet. On its own, the iPad Pro is capable of running the most graphics-intensive programs, like LumaFusion and Procreate. (You have Apple's in-house Silicon M2 to thank for that.) Toss in 5G connectivity and , and you get a productivity beast for your on-the-go duties. Both of those add-ons do come at a cost, but for the enhanced iPadOS experience, we've reasoned that they're worth the money.

**Also: [How to take notes on your iPad with an Apple Pencil](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-take-notes-on-your-ipad-with-an-apple-pencil-3-very-simple-ways/)**

Coming in either the 11-inch or the 12.9-inch, the biggest differences between the iPad Pro configurations are display quality and battery life. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro offers a Liquid Retina XDR display, with XDR being Apple's slang for HDR. This difference is key if you want the most accurate color representation for graphics designing and color-coding videos. The smaller 11-inch iPad is much easier to hold and less of a burden to carry around. 

Both tablets utilize Thunderbolt/USB-4 ports, ideal if you plan on connecting the iPad Pro to an external monitor, storage device, or dock. ZDNET's Jason Cipriani [covered the feature in his full review](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-pro-2021/) and found the increased speed and performance match that of his pricier MacBook Pro.

* Available with LTE
* Lightweight and responsive Surface Pen

Cons

## Microsoft Surface Pro X

### Best stylus tablet for Windows users

**Display**: 13-inch PixelSense display | **Processor**: Microsoft SQ 1 or Microsoft SQ 2 | **Storage**: 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB | **Memory**: 8GB or 16GB | **Biometrics**: Windows Hello face unlock | **Colors**: Matte black or platinum | **Cameras**: 10MP rear, 1080p video. 5MP front-facing camera | **Weight**: 1.7 lbs | **Dimensions**: 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.28 inches | **Connections**: 2 x USB-C, 1 x Surface Connect, 1 x nano SIM | **Battery life:** 15 hours

One of the best Windows-powered stylus tablets comes in the form of Microsoft's Surface Pro X. The 2-in-1 runs on the latest [Windows 11](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-faq-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) operating system and is now offered with an SQ2 ARM-based processor for improved performance and battery life. 

The Surface Pro X is most compatible with the Surface Slim Pen 2, a wireless-charged stylus that enables you to sketch, write, and navigate the tablet with what Microsoft calls "Zero force inking". As the name suggests, using the Slim Pen 2 on the Surface device produces near-zero latency, giving your inputs 4,096 points of pressure and a sense of realism. Like the Apple Pencil, you will have to buy the  separately, and if you want  with a housing for the stylus, then you'll have to pay extra.   

Still, the Surface Pro X is arguably the best Microsoft-owned stylus tablet on the market and offers a familiar Windows experience in a slim and lightweight form factor. It also comes with an LTE variant if you're expecting to use the tablet outdoors.

Pros 
* Lightweight and portable tablet
* iPadOS feature-set is the same as that on the Pro
* Starting price of $551 is fairly affordable versus the competition

Cons 
* Base storage of 64GB may not be enough for power-users
* Second-generation Apple Pencil is sold separately

## Apple iPad Air (2022)

### Best lightweight stylus tablet

**Display**: 10.9-inch Retina display | **Processor**: Apple Silicon M1 | **Storage**: 64GB or 256GB | **Biometrics**: Touch ID | **Colors**: Silver, space gray, pink, purple, blue| **Cameras**: 12MP rear, 4K video. 12MP FaceTime camera | **Weight**: 1.0 lb | **Dimensions**: 9.74 x 7 x 0.24 inches | **Connections**: USB-C port | **Battery life:** 10 hours

The Apple iPad Air (2022) is a worthy alternative to the aforementioned iPad Pro. As the name suggests, It's the most lightweight tablet that Apple offers, and with the latest 2022 model, you're not only getting a revamped design, but a magnetic frame to snap a second-generation Apple Pencil onto. 

While a step short of the performance and capabilities of the Pro model, the iPad Air still runs on the latest version of iPadOS. That means you'll have a very similar software experience, access to the same catalog of Apple-approved tablet apps, and use the Apple Pencil the same way as you would on the more expensive Pro.   

The iPad Air sports a 10.9-inch Retina display and weighs exactly one pound. Together, you get a highly portable stylus tablet that gives you 80% of what the Pro model does, for significantly less money.

## How did we choose these tablets?

After testing each of these tablets for an extended period of time, we found them all to perform exceptionally well as standalone devices, and even better when paired with a stylus.

Form factor was another consideration. Whether you're planning to use a stylus tablet for work, business, or during a commute, there are available options that prioritize portability and comfort, and ones that do best when stationed.

Lastly, some consumers prefer Apple's clear-cut and user-friendly iPadOS, while others enjoy Windows for the customization and PC-like experience. That's why there's a recommended pick for every popular operating system. 

## Can I use any stylus with my tablet?

Tablets are built with capacitive touch screens which allow your fingers to interact with them. That said, most styluses have capacitive tips that function and replicate the same physical input. In turn, it allows them to tap and swipe on virtually all touch screen displays. 

Still, smart features found on the Apple Pencil and Samsung S Pen are hardwired to their respective tablets, limiting the functionality when used with anything else. That's why it's vital to choose the right tool for the job, as it maximizes the benefits of using them.

## What if the stylus breaks?

Whether your stylus breaks or is nowhere to be found, most manufacturers offer replacements at an additional cost or free with a qualified insurance plan. Some insurance options also won't charge a deductible if it's due to a mechanical breakdown. With others, you'll have to fork over a fee, that oftentimes, can be just as much if not more than just replacing the part. 

The Apple Pencil, for example, can be purchased on [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9f2b42b3-9c06-49cc-8dd6-d7646e511f40%7Cdtp&dtb=1). Meanwhile, you can normally find stylus pens through electronic retailers or your cellular provider. 

## Are there alternative stylus tablets worth considering?

We chose options from Android tablets to Apple iPads. If you want more choices, here are several worthy ones to consider:
