Mobile devices make it possible to lounge in bed to watch videos and movies. However, imagine if you have a video on your iPad that you want to show off to everyone in the house, rather than huddle together for a glance, put videos on the big screen TV will no doubt be a better alternative. And this is why video streamers come into being. If you're trying to give your TV a smart boost in a cheap way, the Google Chromecast will certainly be of interest. Said on its office site, "Chromecast is a thumb-sized media streaming device that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV. Simply use an Android phone, tablet, iPhone, iPad".

Easy-to-use and convenient as it is, Chromecast is very limited in the input video formats.
