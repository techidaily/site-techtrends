Mobile devices make it possible to lounge in bed to watch videos and movies. However, imagine if you have a video on your iPad that you want to show off to everyone in the house, rather than huddle together for a glance, put videos on the big screen TV will no doubt be a better alternative. And this is why video streamers come into being. If you're trying to give your TV a smart boost in a cheap way, the Google Chromecast will certainly be of interest. Said on its office site, "Chromecast is a thumb-sized media streaming device that plugs into the HDMI port on your TV. Simply use an Android phone, tablet, iPhone, iPad".

## Issues Occurring When Chromecasting Local Media

_Got a Chromecast recently and I'm having issues with streaming things from a computer. I have tried a few different videos and all of them have had audio/video problems. How can I chromecast AVI, VOB, MKV as my videos are quite different in formats ?_ 
_I am driving crazy by the incapacity to chromecast MKV videos. Most time there is no audio, or the audio is out of sync and the frame rate isn't very good. The same could happen to many other videos like AVI and FLV. How to chromecast local media with both audio and video?_ 

Easy-to-use and convenient as it is, Chromecast is very limited in the input video formats. In other words, chances are that you have stored tons of videos, in formats that are not supported by Chromecast, on your devices and stream video to chromecast for sharing with your family or friends on TV, only to get frustrated at the beginning or result in unsatisfactory results. Here this article introduces a detailed guide on how to play videos on chromecast, more specifically, in supported and unsupported video formats, with a [Chromecast video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

## Part 1: Supported Video Formats of Chromecast

According to the official website, with Google Cast you have several options for supporting various media types, codecs, and facilities:

Video codecs: H.264 High Profile Level 4.1, 4.2 and 5, VP8  
Audio decoding: HE-AAC, LC-AAC, CELT/Opus, MP3, Vorbis  
Image formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, WEBP  
Containers: MP4, WebM

From the above we can see, many popular and widely-used video formats are not in the list of video formats supported by Chromecast, like MKV, AVI, WMV, FLV etc. This means, in view of the few formats compatible with Chromecast, you have to first of all convert your videos with formats not supported by Chromecast. Seems complicated? Not at all in fact. Below a detailed guide on how to stream video to Chromecast, in its supported and unsupported video formats, is introduced.
