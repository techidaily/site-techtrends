## Joining the Twitter Conversation: A Guide to Engaging in Twitter Chats

Close 

 Chats on X (formerly Twitter) are public conversations focusing on a[ hashtag](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hashtag-on-twitter-3486592) , such as a television show, holiday, or news event. Some X chats happen on designated days and specific times, while others are less formal ongoing conversations centered around a hashtag. Here's how to find X chats so you can join in and share your thoughts.

##  How to Find X Chats Using Hashtags 

 Many companies and users create hashtags to get conversations started to promote a TV show, a movie, or a game. The quickest and easiest way to find out about an X chat is to search for hashtags.

 Use the search box in the app or website to look for a topic you're interested in. Good options are names of new movies or TV shows (especially the day after a new episode airs).

 You can also use the Trending window to find ones that are ongoing.

##  How to Find Trending X Chats 

 Another way to find X chats is to see what's trending. If you find something that interests you, it's easy to jump in.

 In a browser, look for the**Explore** option; it'll probably have a magnifying glass icon next to it. From there, you can select**Trending** from the top menu to see what's most popular in your country.

## Third-Party Chat Tools 

 Several third-party[ X chat tools](https://www.lifewire.com/tools-to-follow-twitter-hashtags-3486076) make it easy to find tweet chats. Some of the most popular are[ TwChat](http://twchat.com/) and[ TweetReports](https://www.tweetreports.com/twitter-chat-schedule/) . These tools are web-based and load quickly, even on smartphone mobile browsers. These tools also help find a "live chat," which is an organized X chat set for a certain date and time.

 Some of these tools make participating in chats easier. For example, tchat.io adds your hashtag at the end of your composed tweet, so all you have to do is press the button on their site.

## Why Join a Chat? 

 Aside from being fun, chats are a great way to promote yourself for employment, a work proposal, a product, or an article query to a potential editor. It's an excellent and inexpensive way to interact with customers and friends.

 For example, if you want to promote an event, tell everyone you know to use the same hashtag when talking about it on social media. That way, other X users can search for information about it and join the conversation.
