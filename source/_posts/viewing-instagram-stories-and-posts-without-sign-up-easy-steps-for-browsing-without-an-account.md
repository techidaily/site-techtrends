##  What You Can Do on Instagram Without an Account 

 Viewing Instagram without an account is possible, but quite limited. Here's what you can do when you use Instagram without logging in:  

* **View profiles.** If you know the profile name, you can check the user's profile information as well as see any links they may have in their bio.
* **View images and videos.** You can click an image or video to see the content.
* **See comments.** It's possible to read comments left by registered users.
* **Browse anonymously.** Instagram's algorithm means it can suggest related accounts based on what you've looked at. When not logged in, your activity isn't being tracked.

##  What You Cannot Do on Instagram Without an Account 

 Without an Instagram account, you'll face some limitations:  

* **Post comments** . It's not possible to leave comments or even likes on a photo or video.
* **Follow an account** . There's no way to follow an Instagram account anonymously. You need to be registered to do that.
* **Privately message a user** . DMs are reserved for logged-in users.
* **Search for a profile** . Unless you use a third-party website, you can't search for Instagram users while logged out.

 If you're not happy with the limitations you face when you're not logged in, simply spend a few minutes to[ make an Instagram account](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-instagram-3485864) . It's free, after all.

 FAQ

* How do I view private Instagram profiles?  
 The only way to see a private Instagram profile is if you send the owner a follow request, and they accept it. Only accepted followers or people who were already following when an account became private can see its contents.
* How do I view an Instagram Story anonymously?  
 You must be logged in to see Instagram Stories. Some sites and apps claim to let you download old Stories without being logged in, but you should be skeptical of these, especially if they ask for your password.
