Though both H.264 and MP4 are popular formats, and sometimes, MP4 format is a popular choice for H.264 format, they are not the same.

For example, when the H.264 HD video comes in huge size and is not suitable for your mobile storage. To that end, an H.264 to MP4 converter is needed to convert H.264 files to MP4/MPEG4 format with a smaller size and high quality.

## Part 1\. Why Convert H.264 to MP4 Format?

H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10 or MPEG-4 AVC), is a coding format used for decoding and encoding high-quality videos. As a part of MPEG-4, H.264 has more advanced compression methods than other basic MPEG-4 compression ways. So, it is widely used for YouTube/Vimeo videos, HD DVDs/Blu-ray files, BD players, HDTV, AVCHD recorders, etc.

MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14) is a container format that can contain multiple video and audio streams, subtitles, still images, and other data in one file. Same to H.264, MP4 is widely used over the internet, for iPhones, iPad, mobiles, TV, and more.

**The reasons to convert H.264 file to MP4 format include:**

1. H.264 is a newer format that some older versions of software, player, devices, etc. can recognize.
2. An H.264 file is often larger in size than an MP4 file.
3. H.264 file often comes with HD and 4K resolution which can’t be processed smoothly by all platforms.
4. The H.264 files take more processing power. Especially the HD/4K H.264 videos will require more power to decode or playback, which means that mobiles will run out of battery faster when playing H.264 than MP4.

Based on the facts, you need to convert H.264 to MP4 mpeg4 if you want to keep the high quality of H.264 at a small file size like MP4 format.
