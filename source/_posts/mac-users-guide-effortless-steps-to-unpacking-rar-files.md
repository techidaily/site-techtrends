 This article explains the various ways to restart a[MacBook Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-pro-5096054) , why you would want to restart a MacBook Pro, and how to force restart a MacBook Pro that won't respond to commands.

## How to Restart a MacBook Pro: Apple Menu

 Maybe the easiest way to restart a MacBook Pro is to click a few menus available from pretty much every screen on a Mac. Here's what to do:

 This option works on every model of the MacBook Pro, running all versions of the macOS.

1. Click the**Apple menu** in the top left corner of the screen, then select**Restart** .

2. If you want all of your apps and documents to reopen after the restart, check the box next to**Reopen windows when logging back in** .

## How to Restart a MacBook Pro: Keyboard

 If you prefer it or your MacBook Pro isn't responding to mouse clicks, you can restart it using the keyboard. Here's what to do:

* Hold down the**Control** +**Command** \+ power/eject/Touch ID button simultaneously until the screen darkens and the restart sound plays. After the sound plays, let go of the keys and let the MacBook start up again. This method works on every MacBook Pro model.
* You can also hold down**Control** \+ eject button to get the shutdown dialog box to appear on the screen on some models. From that dialog, click**Restart** .
* If neither of those options work, try a Force Restart by holding down**Control** +**Option** +**Command** \+ the power/eject/Touch ID button.

## When to Restart a MacBook Pro

 We recommend regularly restarting your MacBook Pro for good system maintenance. That's because a restart cleans out active memory (but doesn't lose data) and is often when new software updates get installed. Other times you'll want to restart your MacBook Pro include if it's running slowly, if the operating system or programs are acting buggy, or if the machine freezes up.

## How Restart, Factory Reset, and Power Down Are Different

 Restarting a MacBook Pro isn't the same thing as a factory reset, and it's not the same as[powering it down](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-macbook-pro-5120515) .

* A**restart** resets your operating system and apps and cleans out the active memory that programs run in. You won't lose any data or change anything about how your MacBook Pro runs.
* A[**factory reset**](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-macbook-macbook-pro-4176259) returns your laptop to the state it was in when you first got it out of the box. That means deleting all of the apps you installed and the data you created, wiping the hard drive, and reinstalling macOS. You only want a factory reset if you're selling the MacBook or are taking extreme troubleshooting steps.
* **Powering down** a MacBook Pro turns the computer off and stops all programs from running.
