## Troubleshooting Mapi3nDll Missing Error – Effective Fixes to Try Now
 Mapi32.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the mapi32 [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, mapi32.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware infection, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Mapi32.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented to address the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download mapi32.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mapi32.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mapi32.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . Just make sure the file was working properly before it was deleted (i.e., it wasn't malicious or corrupted).  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. Rename the msmapi32.dll file if you get this DLL error after installing or reinstalling a Microsoft Office program.  
 The error might be seen in this very specific scenario if you have Outlook 2003 installed along with a newer version of Outlook, but then you reinstall the newer version while keeping the older one.  
 Search your computer for msmapi32.dll (not mapi32.dll). It should be here, but use a[file search tool](https://www.lifewire.com/11-free-file-search-tools-1356644) if you can't find it: (1033 is for English versions)  
 `C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Msmapi\1033\`  
 Now rename that file to **msmapi32.old** , and then open Outlook 2003\. It will fix itself by replacing the now-missing msmapi32.dll file with a fresh version, and this should fix the error.  
 Try your best to complete this step, but only if you see the error when using Outlook. This seems to be one of the more common situations that throws this error, so it's likely that you're dealing with this problem.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mapi32.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the mapi32.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration, System Restore could solve the problem.
5. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that uses the mapi32.dll file. If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for hardware devices that might be related to mapi32.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "mapi32.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .
7. [Roll back a driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to a previously installed version if mapi32.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the mapi32.dll file. Since this DLL file is provided by Microsoft,[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) might restore it.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The mapi32.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause mapi32.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) .
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair mapi32.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid mapi32.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. We've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the mapi32.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mapi32.dll errors persist. After a clean installation of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
