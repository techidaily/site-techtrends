##  How to Get Out of iPhone Recovery Mode 

 If entering Recovery Mode and restoring the iPhone succeeds, your phone will automatically exit Recovery Mode when it restarts.

 You can also get your iPhone out of Recovery Mode without restoring your phone (if your device was working properly before. If not, Recovery Mode is still your best option). To do that:

1. Unplug the device from the[ USB](https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039) cable.
2. Hold down the**Side** and either**Volume** button, and then drag the slider to power the iPhone off.  
 Depending on your model, you may need to hold the**Sleep/Wake** button on the top of the device.
3. Keep holding until the Apple logo reappears.
4. Let go of the button and the device will start up.

##  How to Put an iPhone Into Recovery Mode 

 Recovery Mode is a last-resort troubleshooting step you can take with an iPhone having problems with its operating system. Putting a device into Recovery Mode allows the iPhone to run and connect to iTunes or a computer while not booting up the iOS.

 Doing this lets you update the OS to a new, working version or restore a working backup onto the device. It's not hard to use, but it's something you only use when other things don't work.  

 Before trying Recovery Mode, try[ other tips if your iPhone won't turn](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-your-iphone-wont-turn-on-2000281) on, or learn how to[ fix an iPhone stuck on the Apple logo](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-an-iphone-stuck-on-the-apple-logo-2000268) .

 To put an iPhone into recovery mode, follow these steps: 

1. What you do as your first step depends on what iPhone model you have.  
   * If you have an iPhone 8 or newer, you can skip this step.  
   * On an iPhone 7 or earlier, begin by turning off your iPhone by holding down the**Side** button and the**Volume Down** button. Hold until the slider appears at the top, and then swipe the slider. If your phone doesn't respond, hold the**Side** button and [ the iPhone Home button](https://www.lifewire.com/uses-of-iphone-home-button-2000096) together until the screen goes dark (on the iPhone 7 series, hold**Volume Down** instead of the Home button).
2. The second step depends on what operating system your computer is running.  
   * If you have a Mac running macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher, open**Finder** .  
   * If you have a Mac running an earlier version of the OS, or a PC running Windows,[ update iTunes to the latest version](https://www.lifewire.com/update-itunes-latest-version-2000449) and open**iTunes** .
3. Plug the syncing cable into your iPhone and then connect it to your computer.
4. What steps you follow next depend on what model iPhone you have:  
   * **iPhone 8 and newer** : Press and release the**Volume Up** button, and then do the same to the**Volume Down** button. Then press and hold the**Side** button until the Recovery Mode screen appears.  
   * **iPhone 7 series** : Press and hold the**Side** and**Volume Down** buttons until the Recovery Mode screen appears.  
   * **iPhone 6S series and earlier** : Press and hold the**Side** and**Home** buttons until the Recovery Mode screen appears.  
 You'll know your phone is in Recovery Mode when the recovery screen appears.

5. A window pops up in Finder or iTunes (depending on which you used in step 2) offering to let you Update or Restore the phone. Click**Update** . This action tries to fix the problem by updating the operating system without erasing your data.
6. If Update fails, put your iPhone into recovery mode again and this time click**Restore** .  
 This option will replace the data on your phone with an older backup or a fresh installation of the iOS. That's not ideal, but it may be your only option at this point.

##  If Recovery Mode Doesn't Work 

 If putting your iPhone into Recovery Mode doesn't solve your problem, the problem may be more severe than you can fix on your own.

## When to Use Recovery Mode 

 You should use iPhone Recovery Mode when you:

* [ Install an iOS update](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293) , and your device gets stuck in a continuous restart loop. It happens if something goes wrong with the update or your battery is extremely low during the installation.
* Update the operating system or restore the device from a backup, but the process fails, and iTunes no longer sees the device when you connect it.
* Upgrade from a[ beta version of iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/sign-up-apple-ios-public-beta-program-1999744) , and there's a bug.
* See the Apple logo or**Connect to iTunes** icon onscreen for a few minutes with no change.

 Restoring your iPhone using Recovery Mode lets you either update the OS or delete all data on the device. Ideally, you've got a recent backup of your data in iCloud or iTunes. If not, you may end up losing any data added between your last backup and now.
