## [ Responsible AI: Applying AI Principles with Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course%5Ftemplates/388)

![Responsible AI](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a9vc7kQgryt3ejJXOopCw09mSbg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ResponsibleAI-c73e9beb6d2c44b0b0e1906ad4d8f43f.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Google Cloud partners can benefit from the actionable steps.
* Earn a badge of completion to showcase on your Google profile.

 What We Don't Like

* As a Google-focused course, it is narrow in its scope.

 Though this short course is Google-centric, the principles of ethical AI remain relevant.

 The course is organized into distinct modules, each taking you through the best practices followed by Google Cloud. You can then use those frameworks to mold your ethical AI strategy.

 If you're really interested in Google Cloud, be sure to check out[ the next Google Cloud conference](https://www.lifewire.com/google-cloud-next-7556297) .
