## Introducing the New System76 Serval WS: Powered by the Latest 14Th Generation Intel Processor

Need a powerful Linux laptop? The [System76 Serval WS](https://system76.com/laptops/serval) is now equipped with a 14th Gen Intel i9-14900HX CPU and a maximum RTX 4070 GPU. It's a staggering option for professional-grade AI workloads, and it's strong enough to tackle games like _Cyberpunk 2077_ at high graphics settings.

 The first 14th Gen Intel Core processors launched in [late 2023](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/xplore-top-12-gear-best-on-the-go-flip-screen-cameras-for-2024/). These CPUs aren't a substantial leap from the 13th Gen Intel Core lineup, though they improve on AI processing and include new power-saving functionality. Anyway, an upgrade's an upgrade, and System76 is sweetening the deal by upgrading the Serval WS' base configuration to 16GB DDR5-4800 RAM.

 In its maximum configuration, the Serval WS uses a 17.3-inch 4K display with a 144Hz refresh rate, an RTX 4070 graphics card with 4608 CUDA Cores, 64GB of speedy DDR5-5200 memory, and 8TB of M.2 SSD storage (4TB x 2). Customers are stuck with the 14th Gen Intel i9-14900HX CPU, which is just fine. Note that these specs are also available with a smaller 15.6-inch 1080p display—you don't need to buy the big screen to get big performance.

 The laptop's port selection is seriously substantial, with two USB 3.2 (Type A) ports and a pair of USB 3.2 (Type C) ports. Video output is supplied via HDMI, Mini DisplayPort 1.4, and Thunderbolt 4\. There's also a headphone jack and a microSD reader, and the Ethernet port supplies speeds up to 2Gbps. As for wireless connectivity, the Serval WS supports both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, but there isn't a cellular option.

 If you're craving extreme power, be sure to check out the [Thelio desktop PC](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/three-ways-to-sim-unlock-oppo-a78-5g-by-drfone-android/) and [Bonobo WS laptop](https://system76.com/laptops/bonobo). These units began shipping with 14th Gen Intel Core CPUs a few months ago and are higher-spec than the Serval WS. Other products in the System76 catalog will get the 14th Gen Intel Core treatment later this year.

 Pricing for the revised [Serval WS](https://system76.com/laptops/serval) starts at $2,099\. The base configuration is pretty solid but has a very limited storage capacity—you get a 15.6-inch 1080 display, i9-14900HX CPU, RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 500GB of storage. Upgrading to the maximum configuration brings the price to $4,042.
