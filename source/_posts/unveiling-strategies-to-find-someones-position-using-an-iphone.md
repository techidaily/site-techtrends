## Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus

 Artificial intelligence and Google Cloud integration power the entire S24 line. The[S24 and S24+](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-7964194) are the entry-level options, but they still include powerful translation, organization, search, and image-editing features to keep everything quick and easy.

 Galaxy AI is starting on these phones, but Samsung says it's bringing it to more devices in the future, including foldables like the Z Fold and Z Flip and tablets,

 Generative AI with Google's Imagen 2 platform powers the photo-editing options. New tools let you quickly remove or modify both backgrounds and foreground subjects. To maintain security and trust, Samsung says that modified photos will have both a watermark and a note in image metadata noting that they've been altered.

 All S24 phones run on the third generation of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 chipset to handle all the extra work, and they all have a variable refresh rate of 1-120Hz for smoother videos and animations.

### The Coolest Features of the Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus

 AI is key to this year's Galaxy lineup. Samsung showed off plenty of interesting news at the launch, but here are some of our favorites:

* **Translation** : The Live Translate feature automatically translates between 13 languages in text messages and phone calls. The Interpreter feature does the same for live conversations, and it includes a split view so both participants can see everything.
* **Circle to Search** : Sometimes you see something in an app and want to know more about it right now. Circle to Search lets you circle, tab, scribble over, or highlight text and images to see Google search results without opening a browser.
* **Note Assist** : We're used to taking quick notes with little thought to formatting, and it usually comes back to haunt us later. Note Assist makes those quick jots more readable with instant formatting and cleanup.

## Galaxy S24 Ultra

 The premium tier of the S24 series has all the AI and search power of the others, but it includes a way more powerful camera array and some cool materials.

 The[S24 Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-7964195) has two telephoto lenses complementing its wide and ultra-wide options. An updated telephoto has a 50MP resolution, a huge leap from the dual 10MP cameras in last year's S23 Ultra.

 Other improvements this year include a standard 12GB of memory and Wi-Fi 7 compatibility.

 Finally, the S24 Ultra boasts the Galaxy line's first titanium frame and Gorilla Armor, a specially designed glass from Corning.

### The Coolest Features of the S24 Ultra

 The S24 Ultra has many of the same features as the S24 and S24+, but it has some things all its own. Here are our favorites:

* **All the cameras** : The S24 Ultra boasts five lenses with a fleet of new features, like better stabilization, 5x optical zoom, and up to 100x magnification.
* **Big pixels** : Pixels on the S24 Ultra are 60% bigger than the ones in the S23 Ultra. This update makes low-light photos look better.
* **Titanium** : Apple used titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro, and now it's Samsung's turn. This material is tough, light, and looks great. We also like the colors, which branch out from different brightnesses of metal to include purple, yellow, green, blue, and orange.
* **Gorilla Armor** : This new glass from Corning promises both protection from scratches and better visibility.

## The Galaxy Ring

 Samsung revealed no details about the[Galaxy Ring](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-8431146) at the Unpacked on January 17, but it did confirm that it exists and showed a picture. It may be out by the end of the year, and we expect more details soon.

 The ring in the image they showed was gloss black, and it looked to have three clusters of sensors on the inside. We expect it to have many of the health features of the Galaxy Watch 6, which means they could measure heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep, menstrual cycles, BMI, body fat, and more.
