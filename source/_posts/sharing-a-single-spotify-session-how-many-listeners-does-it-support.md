##  Can I Listen to Spotify with a Friend at the Same Time?

 Yes, two people can listen to Spotify simultaneously, thanks to the[ Spotify Jam (formerly Group Session)](https://www.lifewire.com/listen-to-spotify-with-friends-5120356) feature. 

 If you want to add more friends to your listening party, groups of up to 32 people can start listening to a song or a playlist on one device or their own devices via Jam.

 Here's how to start and share a Jam with a friend:  

1. Open Spotify and start playing a song, a playlist, or a podcast.
2. Tap the**Connect** icon from the Now Playing bar.
3. Select the**Start a Jam** .

4. Select**Share link** to send a link in a messaging app or through email.

 Tap**Scan QR Code** to share with friends who are nearby. You can also both tap your phones together to share the Jamâ€”as long as your friend is also logged in to Spotify and is connected to Bluetooth.
5. To exit the Jam, tap**End** if you are the host. As a guest, select**Leave** to remove yourself from a friend's Jam.  
 If the host leaves a Jam, the session automatically ends for everyone else.

 While listening to Spotify simultaneously, both host and guests can control the song or the playlist, unless the host changes this setting. It works just like any individual session:

* Host and guests can pause, play, skip, and select tracks to listen together.
* Anyone can also add songs to the queue in the usual way.
* Any change will show up on all grouped devices in real-time.

 If you want to limit guests to adding tracks only, select the**gear** icon at the top of the Jam page > deselect**Let others change what's playing** .
