## How to Know Your Mac Supports the Monitor You Choose

 To find out exactly what your Mac can handle, you’ll need to check out the technical specifications on Apple’s website.

 Most Mac models allow dual (or more) displays over Thunderbolt or HDMI or a combination of the two. Officially, some MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models only support one external monitor. Before purchasing monitors, double-check the[number of external displays your Mac can support](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-an-external-display-mchl7c7ebe08/mac) .

 Here’s how to find out what kind of monitor your Mac can handle:

1. Navigate to [Apple's site](https://www.apple.com/) , then select Support from the menu bar at the top of the screen.  
![The Support tab highlighted on Apple.com](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/inhhZBzoQolBN4X3zYE1lDNuELo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/maccheckScreenShot2022-11-07at1.47.22PM-add0e9dafa2d4be9852ce7c1418ac055.jpg)  
 Another option is to visit[Apple support's Documentation site](https://support.apple.com/docs) and select**Mac** from the product category tiles to locate specs for your model.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. On the Support page, scroll down to "Search for topics" and type in your Mac's information (model, year, etc).  
![Searching the Support page for a specific model and year of Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_5o--7f-D5Wq3ugFUrbs_sfYck=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/maccheckScreenShot2022-11-07at1.49.10PM-52c2c016edaa482281bfecd37d4a04d1.jpg)
3. From the results page, select **List of Models** and then choose **Identify your model** .  
 If you don't see this option, look for a technical specifications result. For example, if you searched for "MacBook Air 15-inch 2023," look for this option: "MacBook Air (15-inch, M2, 2023) - Technical Specifications."
4. Scroll down the results page until you find your Mac model, and then select the**Tech Specs** link.  
![Tech Specs link for Mac model on Apple.com](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e-8qrWwO_hN_Wy1nd47X6gEvFiU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/maccheckScreenShot2022-11-07at2.04.09PM-337a695bdb2a44d6ac37ec0c325225d9.jpg)
5. Find the**Video Support** section, and look for supported display details. This item could also be labeled**Display Support** .  
![The video support section highlighted on an Apple support page.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vut63kcRCPdM3twlvvZdkHyREYI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003-how-to-set-up-dual-monitors-on-a-mac-8b3dbd4db6d44153a19f5760816ee453.jpg)

 In this example, you can see that a 2011 MacBook Air 13-inch can display its native resolution on the built-in display while also outputting video to an external display at a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. That means this particular Mac could handle a 1080p display easily, but it wouldn’t work with a 4K monitor.

## How to Set Up Dual Monitors On a Mac

 Once you’ve obtained one or multiple monitors for your MacBook or a desktop Mac, you’ve verified your Mac can handle the monitors, and you have either the necessary cables and adapters, you’re ready to set up dual displays on your device.

 Here’s how to set up dual monitors on a Mac:

1. Connect the monitor to the Mac, using the appropriate cable and adapters if necessary.  
 If you’re setting up dual monitors on your Mac, connect both monitors during this step.
2. Position your monitors and Mac where you want them on your desk.
3. Turn on your Mac. It will automatically detect and activate the second monitor, although the settings may not be to your liking.  
 If the monitor doesn’t turn on automatically with the Mac, turn it on manually. If the display is on but not connecting, check out[How to Fix It When Mac is Not Detecting an External Display](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-external-display-not-detected-on-mac-5096070) .

## How to Set Up Displays Wirelessly in Ventura

 Wireless display connection options have been possible as of[macOS Ventura (13)](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-to-macos-ventura-5525478) . The process of wirelessly connecting an additional display is very straightforward. This method is primarily intended to work with other Apple devices.

## How to Choose a Monitor for a Mac

 If you’ve never set up dual monitors before, finding the right monitor can seem like a daunting prospect. To choose the right monitor, you need to consider the display's size, resolution, color accuracy, and other characteristics.

### Match Your Mac

 Before you settle on an additional monitor or a dual monitor setup, make sure that your Mac can handle the resolution. Most Macs can run and exceed 1080p on multiple monitors, but your Mac may not be able to take an additional[4K](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4k-uhd-5199324) display.

 If you have a desktop Mac that already has a monitor, matching that monitor with another identical unit provides the smoothest experience.

 If you’re adding a second monitor to your MacBook, you may want to consider going with a bigger 4K monitor to maximize your screen real estate or a compact flat panel display that you can take with you on the go.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Ports and Inputs

 It’s also important to consider the type of inputs a monitor accepts, but that isn’t as big a deal. If you find the ideal monitor, but it only has HDMI inputs, and you’re using a MacBook that only has USB-C, all you need to do is pick up a USB-C to HDMI adapter or a USB-C hub that includes an HDMI port.

 You can also find adapters to go from HDMI to other outputs like Mini DisplayPort, so don’t let inputs hold you back when choosing a monitor.

 If your Mac is running Catalina or newer and you have an iPad running iPadOS13 and higher, you can[use your iPad as a second monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-ipad-as-second-monitor-1994716) .
