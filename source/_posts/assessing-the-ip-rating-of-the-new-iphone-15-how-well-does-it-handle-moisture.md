## Assessing the IP Rating of the New iPhone 15: How Well Does It Handle Moisture?
 Whether you’re headed poolside or have an accidental spill, the good news is that if you have an iPhone 15, you can safely keep it in the splash zone or near your coffee cup without too much concern. Here’s everything you need to know about your iPhone 15’s water resistance.

## How Water-Resistant Is the iPhone 15?

 While none of the models in the iPhone 15 lineup are waterproof, they do offer a hefty amount of protection against the splash or two. Just how water-resistant is the iPhone 15?

 The iPhone 15 has an IP68 rating, which is determined by the[International Electrotechnical Commission](https://www.iec.ch/ip-ratings) (IEC). This particular protection level falls under IEC’s 60529 standard, which rates electronics’ resistance to water and dust exposure.

 Here’s a breakdown of the two numbers in the IP rating:

* The first number in the IP rating indicates how dust-resistant a device is on a scale from zero (no protection) to six (fully protected).
* The second number in an IP rating relates to a gadget’s water resistance in the same manner, but the scale goes from zero (no water resistance) to nine (protection from even high-pressure hot water at multiple angles).

 So, what does this all mean for the iPhone 15?

* The iPhone 15 can handle plunges in up to about 20 feet (6 meters) of water for a maximum of 30 minutes.
* Outside of large bodies of water, the iPhone 15 is also safe from accidental beverage spills (think soda, coffee, and tea).

## Are iPhones Waterproof?

 It's not just the iPhone 15: No iPhones are completely waterproof. Newer models, starting with the iPhone 12, have the most protection from the iPhone lineup: IP68 protection in up to 20 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.

 The 11 Pro Max and 11 Pro have the same rating but only approximately 13 feet (4 meters) of protection, whereas the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 XS, and iPhone 11 XS Max drop that protection to about 7 feet (2 meters).

 The iPhone 7, iPhone 8 series, iPhone X and XR, and both iPhone SEs hold a reduced level of protection with an IP67 rating: about 3 feet (1 meter) of water protection (for up to 30 minutes).

## What to Do If Your iPhone 15 Gets Wet

 For general moisture exposure, like drink spills, Apple recommends rinsing with water (for non-water liquids) and wiping the device with a lint-free cloth.

 Don’t place cotton swabs–or anything else, really–in the charging port. It’s also best to avoid the popular place-your-phone-in-rice trick, too; you don’t want rice_and_ water inside your device.

 If your iPhone 15 spends a considerable amount of time in water, start by removing the case and turning off the device. Then, try a few Apple-recommended tips for drying it off:

* **Remove excess liquid** : With the Lightning or USB-C port facing down, tap your iPhone lightly against your hand to drain liquid from the device.
* **Let your phone air out** : Place your iPhone somewhere dry, and maybe with a fan facing the charging port.
* **Wait before you charge it** : Apple suggests giving your phone a minimum of five hours before charging it with a Lightning or USB-C cable or attaching any accessories.

 If you use a wireless charging method, make sure the device is completely dry before placing it on your charger.

 For more serious issues, like a[liquid-detection warning](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102643) or[an iPhone that won’t turn on](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-your-iphone-wont-turn-on-2000281) , you may need to do more troubleshooting or consult Apple support.

 Otherwise, for the accidental spill or dunk in the water, following these tips should have you back at the pool or happily sunning on the beach with a dry, fully functional iPhone.

## Can Your iPhone 15 Take Underwater Pictures?

 Your iPhone 15’s IP68 rating means that it’s safe against a dip in the pool, but not an intentional one. Apple recommends avoiding a few water-related activities with your iPhone 15 to reduce the risk of water damage, including:

* Swimming
* Bathing
* High-pressure water exposure (shower jets, water skiing, etc.)
* Steam rooms and saunas
* Water submersion

 However, you could safely snap some underwater pictures with your iPhone secured in[a waterproof phone case](https://www.lifewire.com/best-waterproof-phone-cases-4158190) . It’s worth matching the case to how far you’ll go and the type of activity.

 Plastic-type cases should suffice for the shallow end of the pool, but sturdier aluminum and fully sealed models will be your best bet for deeper waters.
