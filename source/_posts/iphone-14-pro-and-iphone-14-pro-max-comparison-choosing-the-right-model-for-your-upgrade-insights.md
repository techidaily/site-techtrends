##  You should buy the iPhone 14 Pro if...

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

###  1\. You prefer a normal-size phone

For many, including myself, the Pro Max-size iPhones are simply too bulky to use. Perhaps it's the flattened edges that dig into the palms, the [shamelessly large camera island](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-pro-huge-new-camera-sensor-same-slow-lightning-cable-data-transfers/) at the back, or the beefy battery tucked inside, but the largest iPhone with its 6.7-inch screen is by no means "one size fits all." Instead, the [iPhone 14 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-14-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)'s 6.1-inch framework should provide a more manageable handheld experience.

**Also:** [**iPhone 14 drops the SIM card slot. Here's what that means**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-drops-the-sim-card-slot-heres-what-that-means/)

Even with its smaller size, the iPhone 14 Pro carries the same camera system, [iOS 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-when-you-can-install-ios-16-and-watchos-9/), [safety features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-the-apple-iphone-14-connects-to-satellites-during-emergencies/), and long-term support as the Max.

###  2\. Your carrier offers better promotions for the smaller Pro

If you play your cards right, you can technically get an [iPhone 14 Pro for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-deals-how-to-buy-price/) through carrier promotions. The same can't be said about the larger Max variant, which, at its lowest, you can get for around $100 after trade-ins and qualifying payment plans.

###  1\. You prefer a larger phone

Entertainment freaks will go bananas for the [iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-14-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)'s larger, 6.7-inch display. It delivers a more immersive video-watching and general browsing experience than the standard iPhone 14 Pro, and the greater screen real estate makes the new Dynamic Island appear less intrusive (when you're not using it). 

**Also:** [**Apple Watch Series 8 vs Series 7: Which is best for you?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-8-vs-apple-watch-series-7/)

For all the new camera modes that Apple touted during its ['Far Out' event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-during-far-out-event-iphone-14/), the larger viewfinder should serve you better for framing and composing pictures and videos. 

###  2\. You want a longer-lasting battery

Naturally, the iPhone 14 Pro Max's battery will last much longer than the smaller variant. Apple says the Max can handle up to 29 hours of video playback (versus the 14 Pro's 23) and we expect real-world testing numbers to be just as promising. Stay tuned to ZDNET for the full review.
