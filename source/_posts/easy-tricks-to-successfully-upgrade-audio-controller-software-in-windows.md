### Key Takeaways

 To update your Windows audio drivers, open Device Manager, right-click your sound card, and choose "Update Driver." Other update methods include using Windows Update and downloading and installing the latest drivers from your manufacturer's website.

 You can fix your various sound issues and possibly get general audio enhancements by [updating your audio drivers](https://win11.techidaily.com/classic-game-connector-directing-past-fun-into-the-future/). You can do this using Device Manager, Windows Update, and your audio card maker's website. We'll show you how to do this on your Windows 10 or 11 PC.

##  Use Device Manager to Update Sound Drivers

 The easiest way to update your audio drivers is to [use Windows' built-in Device Manager tool](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-your-creative-potential-in-making-fb-reels-for-2024/). This tool automatically finds and installs the latest drivers for your devices, including your sound card drivers.

 To use it, open the "Start" menu, search for "Device Manager", and select the tool.

![Select &quot;Device Manager.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-open-windows-device-manager.png) 

 In Device Manager, beside "Sound, Video and Game Controllers," click the right-arrow icon.

 In the expanded menu, [right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) your audio card and choose "Update Driver."

![Choose "Update Driver."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-device-manager-update-audio-drivers.png) 

 On the window that opens, select "Search Automatically for Drivers."

![Click "Search Automatically for Drivers."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-device-manager-find-sound-drivers.png) 

 If newer drivers are available for your sound card, follow the on-screen instructions to install them.

 And you're now rocking the most recent sound drivers on your computer.

##  Use Windows Update to Get the Latest Audio Drivers

 Another way to update your PC's various drivers is to use Windows Update. This feature [checks for Windows operating system updates](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/innovative-ai-tools-to-spark-your-podcast-written-name/) and for updates to your attached hardware devices, including your audio card.

 It's worth trying this method if Device Manager couldn't find the latest drivers for your sound card.
