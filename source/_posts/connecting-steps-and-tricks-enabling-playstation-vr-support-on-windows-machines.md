## Connecting Steps & Tricks: Enabling PlayStation VR Support on Windows Machines
### What to Know

* You'll need your PSVR, Trinus PSVR, an HDMI cable, and a USB 3.0 cable to connect it to your PC.
* Connect the USB to a USB 3.0 port on your PC, and connect the HDMI cable to your PC.
* You can use an HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter if need be.

 This article explains how to connect a PSVR to a PC. Unlike PC VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift or the Valve Index, you can't simply connect your PSVR to a PC and start playing games. Once you follow our steps below, you'll be able to do that.

## How to Connect PSVR to PC

 To connect PSVR to PC, you'll need your headset, a USB 3.0 cable, and an HDMI cable. You'll need to connect your headset directly to your PC. If you don't have an open HDMI connection, you can pick up an HDMI-to-DisplayPort cable or adapter and use that without issue.

1. To connect a PSVR to a PC, you'll need to at least install one piece of software. We're going to use[Trinus PSVR](https://www.trinusvirtualreality.com/) for this article.  
 This application includes the necessary drivers to make sure Windows properly recognizes the headset. Simply download the application and follow the on-screen instructions.

2. Once Trinus PSVR is installed, plug your HDMI cable into the**PS4 HDMI** port on the PSVR processing unit.
3. Plug the other end of the HDMI cable directly into your PC.  
 Most PCs support HDMI so you likely have an HDMI port. Also, it's easy to switch over a display from HDMI to DisplayPort to free up a slot if you need to.
4. Plug one end of the USB 3.0 cable into the processing unit.
5. Plug the other end of the USB 3.0 cable into a USB 3.0 port on your computer. It doesn't have to be USB 3.0, though this will give you the best possible performance.  
 USB 3.0 ports are usually identified by the blue color of the port as opposed to regular black USB ports.
6. Press the power button on the headset. Windows should recognize the headset as a new display connected to your PC.
7. From the**Start menu** , head to**Settings** \>**System** \>**Display** \>**Multiple Displays** . Make sure the headset is set to**Extend these displays** and its resolution is set to**1920 x 1080** .

8. Once Windows configuration is done, your PSVR headset is now fully connected to your PC!

## Is VR better on PC or PlayStation?

 On a PS4, VR experiences aren't significantly different from their PC counterparts, but PSVR runs games at lower resolutions and with lower frame rates than traditionally found on PC. With the launch of the PS5, many VR games have been updated to support higher frame rates and resolutions than what was originally supported on PS4.

 While it may still be technically possible to run games on PSVR on PC better than you can on PlayStation itself, the limitations of the display are going to limit the experience compared to other PC headsets, such as the Rift, that support higher frame rates and resolutions than PSVR.
