 It’s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.
