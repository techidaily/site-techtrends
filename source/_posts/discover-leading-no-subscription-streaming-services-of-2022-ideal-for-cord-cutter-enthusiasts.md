## Any Alternative Ways to Watch Live Steam Contents? 

Surely you can get a decent experience on watching content on live streaming services. But almost all of them are for a fee. And there must be some moments that you want to watch TV shows or movies across several live TV streaming services. For example, you'd like to watch Game of Thrones on HBO Now, as well as enjoying Roma on Netflix. It will be a waste to purchase several live streaming services with similar contents simultaneously. And though a cable box or satellite dish isnâ€™t required to stream TV, you still need something to get started with any of live streaming services, namely high-speed internet service, compatible streaming devices, and digital antenna. Given that, is there any alternative way to watch live stream contents? 

**Option 1:** If you precisely want to watch an exclusive TV series or movies in a streaming service, but you have subscribed another one, you can rent or purchase the content alone. For that, you're recommend to rent or purchase a DVD disc and make a digital copy of the movie or TV series by youself with a DVD ripper. 

**Option 2:** Forget live streaming services, watch or download your desired content from online sites like YouTube, Dailymotion etc. But if you want to watch some exclusive TV shows or movies of other streaming services on YouTube, you need rent or purchase it on YouTube. By the way, [**MacX YouTube Downloader**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) allows you to save TV shows, movies, videos up to 4K UHD offline for watching.
