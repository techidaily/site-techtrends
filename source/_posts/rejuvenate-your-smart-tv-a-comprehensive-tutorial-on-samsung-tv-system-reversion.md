## Set Your Samsung TV to Update Automatically

 The best way to keep your Samsung smart TV updated is to set up automatic updates. That way, you can set it and forget it; updates will arrive while you're using your TV and then finish up the next time your device is turned on. Here's how to enable auto updates:

 Although there's technically a difference between software and[firmware updates](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-firmware-2625881) , Samsung often uses the term “Software Update” to include both.

1. Make sure your TV is connected to the internet.
2. Go to**Settings** \>**Support** \>**Software Update** .
3. Select**Auto Update** to toggle the option**On** .

 If an update is detected when you first turn the TV on, it will download and install it before you can proceed to watch anything or use the TV's other functions. This may take several minutes, depending on the nature of the update.

## Update Your TV Manually via the Internet

 If your TV is connected to the internet, but you prefer to activate software updates manually, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Support** \>**Software Update** .
2. Select**Update Now** . If an update is available, the download and installation process will be initiated in the same manner as discussed in the Auto Update section above.  
![Samsung TV Software Update Screen — Now Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZYg-Zkd-l18SYpy5NBZaszTbKnE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-tv-soft-firmware-update-abc-5b3bffcdc9e77c00375fe757.jpg)
3. If no updates available, select**OK** to exit the Settings menu and proceed to use the TV.

## Update Your TV Manually via USB

 If your TV isn't connected to the internet or if you prefer to install updates locally, you have the option of doing this via USB. To use this option, you need to first download the update to a computer, then transfer it to a USB device. Here's how to do this:

1. Visit the[Samsung Download Center](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fdownloads%2F) .
2. Enter the model number of your TV in the text box (e.g., UN40KU6300FXZA).
3. When you see your TV populate in the list of suggestions, select it to open its download page.

4. Locate the firmware for your TV from the**Firmware** section, and select**Download** next to it. If there are multiple to choose from, select the item at the top to get the latest version.

 The download might take a few minutes, depending on the file's size and the speed of your internet.
5. Save the[ZIP file](https://www.lifewire.com/zip-file-2622675) to your computer, then unzip it to reveal its contents.
6. With a[flash drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-flash-drive-2625794) plugged in to your computer, copy all the contents of the unzipped file onto the flash drive.  
 Do not copy the .ZIP file itself (only its extracted contents) and do not put the files into any other folder on the flash drive (just the[root](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-root-folder-or-root-directory-2625989) of the drive).
7. After the files are fully copied to the USB drive, unplug it from your computer and plug it into your TV.  
 If you have more than one USB port on your TV, make sure no other devices are plugged into any of the other ports.
8. From the TV remote, select the**Home** or**Smart Hub** **icon** , then the**Settings** icon on the TV screen, which looks like a gear.
9. Go to**Support** \>**Software Update** \>**Update Now** .
10. Select**Yes** , or choose the**USB** option, if prompted for either. You'll see a message on the screen that reads "Scanning USB. This may take more than 1 min."  
 Do not turn off your TV during the update process. It must remain powered on until the update is complete. The TV will turn off and on automatically after completing the update, which reboots the TV. Depending on the nature of the update, audio and video settings may reset to their factory defaults.
11. Follow any further prompts to start the update process.

12. When the process is completed, the TV will turn off automatically, then turn back on, indicating the software update installed correctly and is ready to use.
13. To further confirm you've updated the software, you can return to the**Software Update** page to see the latest update.
