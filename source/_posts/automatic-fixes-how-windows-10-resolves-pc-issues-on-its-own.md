![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58589dd357321-600x383.jpg)If you also find that you Windows Update stuck at a certain number, 0% or any other figure, when downloading updates and freezes there, this post will help you solve the problem quickly and easily by yourself. Before you make any moves, make sure that your Windows Update is actually**_stuck_**since some of the update patches could take minutes or hours or more to configure or install. If nothing happens on your PC screen for more than 3 hours or more, and you cannot see the hard drive activity light, then your update is stuck. There are many unclear reasons why this problem is happening, therefore, there are different solutions to tackle this issue. We will be introducing one of the most useful methods:**restart your Windows Update services**. The detailed instructions are as follows. 1) On your keyboard, press**Windows logo key**and**X**at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)**from the list of choice. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_5858a50df1ba3.png)Click **Yes**at the prompted administrative permission. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_5858a5562d15c.jpg)2) Type in**net stop wuauserv**and hit**Enter**.

If some of the files refuse to be deleted, you need to restart your computer. After restart, repeat step 1) and 2), then delete the files again. 4) After emptying the**SoftwareDistribution**folder, restart your computer. 5) On your keyboard, press**Windows key**and**X**at the same time, then choose**Command Prompt (Admin)**from the list of choice. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_5858a50df1ba3.png)Hit**Yes**at the prompted administrative permission. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_5858a5562d15c.jpg)6) Enter**net start wuauserv**and hit**Enter**. Wait for the process to finish. Then enter**net start bits**and hit**Enter**. Wait for the process to finish. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_5858a8c92cd6b.jpg)7) Launch your**Windows Update**again to see if the update goes all well now. When the update completes, it is suggested that you restart your PC to complete the process.

## **PRO TIP**

When the update finishes, you may need to update all available device drivers in your PC.  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update all drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks: 1) Download and install[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the driver you need to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).  Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
