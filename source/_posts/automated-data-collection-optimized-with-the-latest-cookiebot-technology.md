#### What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)? 

  
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge Al methodology that optimizes the accuracy and quality of LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge sources.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized content generation, but their responses aren't always consistent. They're only as dynamic and relevant as the data used to train them.

With impeccable data delivered through purpose-built AI powering your RAG technology, your LLM will dynamically pull information from a vast external text database, based on each query. This gives the model access to the most current, verifiable facts. It also allows for more nuanced and context-rich answers, which is particularly valuable in sectors that require in-depth topic knowledge.

#### Transform hidden data into valuable insights 

  
Today, 90% of business data is stored in formats that challenge traditional “extract, transform, load” (ETL) processing. These formats include PDF, TIFF, PNG, PPTX, or DOCX. This level of data inaccessibility hinders complete business transformation.

We leverage purpose-built AI to help you extract meaningful insights from any type of document. Vantage, our [intelligent document processing platform](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), uses advanced AI techniques to extract, classify, and deliver data from documents. By integrating Vantage, your document data enables enriched and more relevant insights, based on a broader knowledge base for your LLM.

### How does retrieval-augmented generation work?

Users typically give a large language model (LLM) a prompt or input, and receive a response based on its training data. RAG utilizes the user input to pull information from relevant external data sources. The user input and new information are then fed into an LLM to improve response quality. This process takes place in four steps:

* Compile external data
* Retrieve relevant information
* Improve the LLM input

#### Compile external data

The RAG model gathers data from various external sources, such as APIs, databases, or documents. This data is converted into numerical representations for the LLM to understand.

![RAG-step01-1](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/company/rag/steps/rag-step01-1.png?h=442&iar=0&w=1200)

#### Retrieve relevant information

The user's query is converted into a vector and compared with the vector databases to find the most relevant information. It uses mathematical vector calculations to assess the relevance of information.

![RAG_diagram-step02](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/company/rag/steps/rag_diagram-step02.svg?iar=0)

#### Improve the LLM input

The system integrates relevant retrieved data into the user’s input to enhance LLM understanding. It uses prompt engineering techniques to ensure the generated response is clear and communicated effectively.

##### Why is retrieval-augmented generation important?

RAG ensures LLMs retrieve information from accurate and relevant knowledge sources. LLMs are intelligent AI tools, but a crucial drawback is they may provide outdated information by drawing from static training data.

As a result, responses from conventional language generation models might be too generic or even inaccurate. RAG gives enterprises more confidence and control over generated outputs and the response generation process.

##### What are the benefits of retrieval-augmented generation?

There are three key benefits of RAG:

**1\. Relevant information**

RAG provides current and reliable sources to LLMs, ensuring users receive the latest information.

**2\. Improved user confidence**

RAG allows for source attribution, citations, and references. This increases users' confidence in generated responses.

**3\. Cost-effective training**

RAG is a more affordable alternative to retraining a foundation model, making generative AI technology accessible.

##### What’s the difference between retrieval-augmented generation and semantic search?

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search offer different approaches to information retrieval and generation. RAG combines language generation models with information retrieval techniques. It finds and integrates external data into large language models (LLMs) to improve response quality. In contrast, semantic search scans extensive databases to retrieve precise information. It accurately maps queries to relevant documents and returns specific text. 

In summary, RAG prioritizes response generation from retrieved data, while semantic search focuses on delivering semantically relevant passages.

##### How can ABBYY support my digital transformation journey?

You'll receive ongoing support from your initial consultation and beyond. We draw on our extensive AI and machine learning knowledge to partner with you on your journey. With our partner ecosystem, designed to guide our customers through digital transformation, we can ensure smooth AI integration into your business processes.
