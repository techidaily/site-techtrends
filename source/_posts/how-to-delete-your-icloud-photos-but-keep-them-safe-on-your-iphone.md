### Tip

 When deleted, photos and videos are shifted to the**Recently Deleted** folder on both iCloud and the iPhone. They will be permanently deleted after 30 days, thus making it possible to recover them if you change your mind. To remove them permanently before 30 days, go to the Recently Deleted folder and select**Delete All** .

## Understanding the 'Optimize iPhone Storage' Setting

 If**Optimize iPhone Storage** is enabled, all your full-resolution photos and videos are kept on iCloud and only the latest photos and videos are on the iPhone.

 When the iPhone is low on storage, the iPhone will upload the full-resolution images (and videos) to iCloud and replace them with smaller-sized versions on your iPhone.

 If you delete anything from iCloud Photos, ensure you have the**Download and Keep Originals** option selected. Now, your entire photo library will remain on your phone (if there is enough free storage) even when you turn off iCloud Photos and start deleting photos from the cloud.

 FAQ

* How do I download photos from iCloud?  
 To[download photos from iCloud](https://www.lifewire.com/download-photos-from-icloud-5218261) , go to**iCloud.com** \> select**Photos** \> choose the photo(s), and select the**Download** icon (the cloud and down-arrow) at the top. To download the original version of the photo or video (in the original format with no edits), click and hold the**Download** icon and select**Unmodified Original** .
* How do I upload photos to iCloud?  
 To upload a photo to iCloud, go to**iCloud.com** \> select**Photos** \>**Upload** icon (the cloud and up-arrow) at the top. Or, drag files from your computer to the Photos folder in your browser.
* Why aren't my photos uploading to iCloud?  
 Uploads may be paused when your battery is low or when you're connected to cellular. Restart your device, check your internet connection, and charge your battery.
* Do Photos stay on iCloud if deleted from iPhone?  
 iCloud Photos is not a backup of a set of photos from your iPhone. Instead it is a replica of your current photo library on your iPhone. If you delete from either place (iCloud Photos or your iPhone), the syncing feature deletes the photo in the other place. The only way to keep a photo on the iPhone while deleting it from iCloud is to turn off the automatic syncing. This action will not work if you later turn iCloud Photos back on.
