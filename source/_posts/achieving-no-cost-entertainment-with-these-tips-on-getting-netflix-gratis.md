## Achieving No-Cost Entertainment with These Tips on Getting Netflix Gratis

Close 

###  What to Know

* Become an extra member on someone else's Netflix account.
* Create profiles:**Profile** \>**Who's watching** \>**Manage Profiles** \>**Add** **Profile** \> enter name >**Continue** \>**Done** .
* Some companies, like T-Mobile, offer promotions that include a free Netflix account.

 Netflix is a streaming service with a ton of great content, including original shows and movies you can't watch anywhere else. Between increasing membership fees, and tough economic times, not everyone can afford to subscribe, but there are a few ways to watch Netflix for free.

 If you're hoping to find ways to get more Netflix free trials, don't get too excited. Netflix has ended free trials in the U.S. with the reasoning that it's free to cancel your subscription anytime.

##  Share Netflix Accounts With Friends or Family 

 The basic Netflix plan only allows you to watch one show or movie at a time, but the standard and premium plans allow you to watch multiple things on multiple devices. With the standard plan, you can watch up to two things at once, and the premium plan allows you to stream up to four shows or movies at the same time.

 The basic Netflix plan doesn't support[ HD streaming](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830) , so if you know anyone with a Netflix subscription, there's a good chance they have the standard or premium plan. If they're willing to add you as an extra member to their account, you can log in and watch whatever you want without interfering with their binge-watching.

 Netflix officially ended password sharing in May 2023, only allowing family and friends in the same household to share an account. The workaround is adding extra members for a monthly fee; the Standard plan allows for one extra member while the Premium subscription allows for two.

##  How to Share Your Netflix Account 

 Netflix allows you to create up to five separate profiles under one household, each with separate watch lists and recommendations. Profiles allow you to share your account without your friends or family clogging up your recommendations with shows you have no interest in.

 Here's how to set up a separate Netflix profile on Netflix.com:

1. On the**Who's watching?** screen, select**Manage Profiles** .  
 From your profile home screen, select your**user icon** \>**Manage Profiles** in the upper right corner.  
![Manage Profiles button on Netflix home page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w0BHPjVo7iJQMp0IkLHzx7HK25c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-to-get-netflix-for-free-4173976-5c37aab946e0fb00017e263f.jpg)  
​
2. Select**Add Profile** .  
![Add Profile button on Netflix Manage Profiles page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sHoLjTAfrZ--mROofQR511Z1epY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_how-to-get-netflix-for-free-4173976-5c37ab0c46e0fb0001216785.jpg)  
​
3. Enter a name for the new profile, and select**Continue** .  
![Continue button in Add Profile screen on Netflix](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v0S5D2vKyfQGFr-7TdKmpbfeqAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-to-get-netflix-for-free-4173976-5c37ab5bc9e77c0001c4430c.jpg)  
​
4. Select**Done** .

 You cannot assign a different password to each profile. New profiles log in using the same email and password you use. Only share your Netflix account with family members and friends that live with you. Otherwise, Netflix will penalize you for sharing outside the household. As the account holder, you're responsible for the actions taken by anyone you allow to use your account.

##  How to Get Netflix for Free from Your Phone or Cable Company 

 Some companies, including cellphone providers and cable companies, offer promotions that include a free Netflix account. This account isn't exactly free since you need to buy something to get it, but it is a valid way to get Netflix without paying for it directly.

 If you're in the market for a new phone or cable provider anyway, it may be worth checking to see if this would be a good deal. And if you're already a customer of a company that provides free Netflix, there's no downside to taking advantage of the offer.

 For more information, contact your phone or cable company and ask if they offer any plans that provide free access to services like Netflix or others.

##  How to Get Netflix for Free with T-Mobile 

 T-Mobile throws in a Netflix account at no extra charge, but the deal isn't available for all customers. If you opt for a plan that doesn't require a credit check or a prepaid plan, the free Netflix offer is off the table.

![T-Mobile webpage showing Netflix deal](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2tTer4JRb9eaek_2BPN6rFunbKs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ScreenShot2019-01-10at12.06.32PM-5c37b417c9e77c0001038937.jpg) 

​ 

 Here's how to get free Netflix from T-Mobile:

1. Sign up for an eligible T-Mobile Go5G plan.
2. Make sure you don't opt for a prepaid or no credit check plan.
3. Add at least one additional line to your plan. The free Netflix offer is only available if you have at least two lines.
4. Opt-in to the**Netflix On Us** feature.
5. Wait for a text message from T-Mobile, and follow the instructions.

 T-Mobile may change[ the terms of service for Netflix](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-36253) at any time.
