## What is Facebook?

 Facebook is a social networking website where users can post comments, share photographs, and post links to news or other interesting content on the web, chat live, and watch short-form video.

 Shared content can be made publicly accessible, or it can be[ shared only among a select group of friends or family](https://www.lifewire.com/see-who-shared-post-facebook-4580318) via Facebook Groups, or with a single person.

## How Facebook Began

 Facebook began in February of 2004 as a school-based social network at Harvard University. It was created by Mark Zuckerberg along with Edward Saverin, both students at the college. It wasn't until 2006 that Facebook opened to anyone 13 years or older and took off, rapidly overtaking MySpace as the most popular social network in the world.

 Facebook's success can be attributed to its ability to appeal to both people and businesses and its ability to interact with sites around the web by providing a single login that works across multiple sites.

##  Why Users Like This Social Media Option

 Facebook is user-friendly and open to everyone. Even the least technical-minded people can sign up and begin posting on Facebook. Although it started out as a way to keep in touch or reconnect with long-lost friends, it rapidly became the darling of businesses that were able to closely target an audience and deliver ads directly to the people most likely to want their products or services.

 Facebook makes it simple to share photos, text messages, videos, status posts and feelings on Facebook. The site is entertaining and a regular daily stop for many users.

 Unlike some social network sites, Facebook does not allow adult content. When users transgress and are reported, they are banned from the site.

 Facebook provides a customizable set of privacy controls, so users can protect their information from getting to third-party individuals.
