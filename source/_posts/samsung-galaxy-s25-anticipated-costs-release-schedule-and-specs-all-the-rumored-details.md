 Since[the latest Samsung Galaxy phones](https://www.lifewire.com/newest-samsung-galaxy-phone-7567396) were launched just this year, there's not a lot in the way of Galaxy S25 leaks. Nevertheless, we have some ideas about this upcoming smartphone pair and will keep this page updated as we uncover new rumors and leaks throughout the year.  

## When Will the Samsung Galaxy S25 Be Released?

 Samsung consistently releases its Galaxy S series phones during the first half of each year. With a track record of unveiling new models every year since 2010, there's no need for speculation about the arrival of new Samsung phones.

 Since the Galaxy S24 debuted in 2024, we can expect the Galaxy S25 and S25+ to land in 2025.  

### Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

January or February 2025 is our best guess right now.

## Samsung Galaxy S25 Price Rumors

 Nobody knows for sure what Samsung will charge for the Galaxy S25 and S25+. Official prices won't be revealed until the phones are formally announced next year. However, if we look at the pricing trend of the latest phones, we can estimate how much the Galaxy S25 might cost:

* **Galaxy S25 (128 GB)** \- $799.99
* **Galaxy S25 (256 GB)** \- $859.99
* **Galaxy S25+ (256 GB)** \- $999.99
* **Galaxy S25+ (512 GB)** \- $1119.99

 As always, though, these numbers are easily influenced by hardware changes. For example, it's expected that the processor in these phones will be more expensive than the one used in the S24 phones, so you might bear the brunt of that cost.

 These prices also need to account for inflation. Given that the S23 and S24 phones maintained the same price, Samsung might be inclined to raise the prices to accommodate general increases in production costs.

## Pre-Order Information

 Samsung Galaxy S25 pre-orders will start when the phones are announced early next year.

 Interested in a foldable phone? Samsung's[Z Fold 6](https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-z-fold-6-8418354) and[Z Flip 6](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-8621840) are coming this year.

## Samsung Galaxy S25 Features

[Android 15 will arrive later this year](https://www.lifewire.com/android-15-7547471) , so the Galaxy S25 will run that version of the Android OS (with the[One UI](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-one-ui-4178405) 7 skin). Samsung will likely support the S25 for the same length of time as in past years, meaning you'll get major Android operating system updates and security fixes for seven years.

 Details are limited this early in the rumor stage, but here are some new features we expect to see in these phones:

* **Gemini Nano 2** : This is Google's on-device AI model. The first version powers[Galaxy AI](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fgalaxy-ai%2F) on the Galaxy S24 series, so it's hardly a guess to say v2 will land next year. AI enhancements will impact image processing, photo editing, texting, and pretty much everything else on the phone.
* **Seamless updates** : Background updates let you continue using your phone while a new version of the OS gets installed. This, surprisingly, has not been the case for Samsung phones[until recently](https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1770827713567158730) , so it looks like we'll see this change when the Galaxy S25 phones arrive.

## Samsung Galaxy S25 Specs and Hardware

 Despite many months remaining until the 2025[Samsung Unpacked](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-unpacked-news-and-rumors-5093153) event, there are some Galaxy S25 leaks and rumors we can review thus far. Of course, certain aspects are likely to remain consistent, such as the flat edge design and minimal bezels.

 Aside from the possibility of some slight design changes (that's all we've heard; no details yet), here are the bigger changes we're looking forward to:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Newer Processor

 The next Samsung Galaxy phones will likely be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 in the US and the Exynos 2500 everywhere else. The Qualcomm processor[is said to support faster RAM](https://wccftech.com/lpddr6-support-for-snapdragon-8-gen-not-for-a18-pro/) , which will be much needed as on-device AI continues to work its way into these phones.

 We're not yet sure how much RAM these phones could be packing, but we're hoping the base model has 12 GB and the Plus model increases to 16 GB. More RAM means that AI can work faster because it can run some of its operations locally, and other phone functions will also benefit.

### Larger Displays

[If this rumor is true](https://twitter.com/TheGalox%5F/status/1782058803468423431) , next year's phones could be a little bigger. The X/Twitter post states that the Galaxy S25 will increase from a 6.2-inch display to a 6.36-inch one. It's not a_huge_ change, but it could usher in more than just a bigger screen.

 The Galaxy S25+ could be bigger, too, but we haven't seen any supporting leaks. The current model is 6.7 inches and we don't see that changing unless the Galaxy S25 Ultra_also_ increases in size, since it's already 6.8 inches.

### Better Image Quality

 A larger phone, overall, means Samsung could stuff a bigger battery into the phone or work in some different cameras. Currently, Samsung and other phone makers use Samsung's ISOCELL sensor for their phone cameras.

 Unfortunately, the same sensor found in the S24 (and S23) phones[could be incorporated into the Galaxy S25](https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-primary-camera-reuse-s24-s25/) . However, some discussions suggest that Samsung might go with Sony's LYTIA brand of sensors instead, potentially using the same LYT-808 sensor found in the OnePlus 12.

 We expect some news to break closer to the launch date to clear this up.  

 It also looks like[the battery isn't changing either](https://www.androidauthority.com/leak-samsung-galaxy-25-battery-3451473/) . The same 4000mAh battery found in the S24 might be used for at least another year.

### Other Changes

* In addition to faster RAM, these phones might come with faster hard drives,[potentially doubling the speed to 8 GB/s](https://www.sammobile.com/news/next-gen-samsung-galaxy-phones-faster-storage/) . This, again, is useful for everything you do on your phone but is especially beneficial for all the local AI smarts the S25 lineup will surely include.
* The S24 supports fast wired charging at 25W, which is a bit slower than similar devices like the Pixel 8 which is rated for 27W. We haven't seen any leaks about this changing next year, but we can still hope for the best.
* The S25 phones could follow Google's lead with the[Pixel 9](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-9-8630767) and support Qi2, the next version of the[Qi wireless charging standard](https://www.lifewire.com/qi-wireless-charging-4151894) .
