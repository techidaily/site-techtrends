## What Causes a MacBook Air to Freeze?

 Many simple fixes can solve a frozen MacBook Air. It can be due to a malfunctioning program, an issue with macOS itself, or a hardware fault such as overheating or a RAM problem. Each of these issues has very different solutions.

 Fortunately, you can fix many of these issues at home, but there are certain cases where your MacBook Air needs to be professionally repaired by Apple or may even be beyond repair.

4. Restart your MacBook Air. If you can't force quit the app and your MacBook Air isn't responding, shut down the computer. You'll lose all unsaved work, but it can fix many freezing issues.
5. Unplug any peripherals attached to your MacBook Air. Sometimes, a peripheral can be causing an issue with your MacBook Air. Try unplugging it to see if it corrects the problem.

If you're using a MacBook Air running OS X Yosemite or earlier, you may need to repair permissions to ensure any application you have issues with runs correctly.
