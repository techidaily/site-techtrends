## How to Automatically Log On to Windows

 There are plenty of good reasons to auto log in to your computer, and there are several reasons not to (see the_Is It Safe_ section below). If security isn't an issue, follow these steps to make Windows log in automatically:  

1. Press**Win** +**R** to open the Run dialog box, then enter this into the text box and press**Enter** to open the Advanced User Accounts program:  
 `netplwiz`  
![Screenshot of the User Accounts window and Run box in Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BICxKgXAn96fZ7yE5iZL8AgdlQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/user-accounts-auto-login-windows-10-5ae0f7b1a474be00365cc57e.PNG)  
 Advanced User Accounts Window (Windows 10).  
 A different command is used in Windows XP:  
 `control userpasswords2`  
 Technically, this program is called the_Advanced User Accounts Control Panel_ , but it's not really a Control Panel applet and you won't find it in Control Panel. To make it more confusing, the title of the windows says just_User Accounts_ .
2. In the**Users** tab, uncheck the box next to **Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer** .  
![Checkbox next to Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer in User Accounts window, Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/T5n8YqosSlQDqoBzckQUD2kqKh4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-do-i-auto-login-to-windows-2626066-5bd105c746e0fb0051d587a9.jpg)  
 Don't see that option? Skip to the next section below these steps to learn how a small tweak to the Windows Registry can reveal this checkbox.

3. Select**OK** at the bottom of the window.  
![OK button after Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer checkbox is unchecked](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Jid5rcDhN0RyGcKE4dmqgIVLB3I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_how-do-i-auto-login-to-windows-2626066-5bd105e9c9e77c005114a69c.jpg)
4. When the password prompt appears, enter the username you wish to use for your automatic login, followed by the password in the next two boxes.  

 In Windows 11, 10, and 8, if you're using a Microsoft account, be sure to enter the entire email address that you use to sign in to Windows, in the**User name** field. The defaults there might instead be the name associated with your account, not your actual username.
5. Select**OK** to save and close the open windows.  
![OK button in Automatically sign in window appears in Windows 10 User Accounts panel](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NbSrcUiWhOzBqCWlhrmtJvXMDdo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-do-i-auto-login-to-windows-2626066-5bd1061646e0fb00264cb246.jpg)
6. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) and make sure that Windows automatically logs you in. You may catch a glimpse of the sign-in screen, but only long enough to see it log you in without you having to type anything!

 Are you a Desktop lover looking to speed up your Windows 8 boot process even more? In Windows 8.1 or later, you can make Windows start directly to the Desktop, skipping the Start screen. See[How to Boot to the Desktop in Windows 8.1](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-boot-to-the-desktop-in-windows-8-1-2626240) for instructions.

## Is the Automatic Login Checkbox Missing?

 Follow these registry editing steps if you don't see the automatic login option in Windows 10 or Windows 11:

1. [Open Registry Editor](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-registry-editor-2625150) . It's most easily done by executing**regedit** from the search box after you select the Start button.  
![regedit command in Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/S5plzssdJfj5F_g0EWjnrY3y0y0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/regedit-command-windows-10-a994eadfb12045c0bf2f41b22e2d65b0.png)  
 While following the steps below_exactly_ should be perfectly safe, we always recommend that you[back up the registry](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-back-up-the-windows-registry-2625146) before making changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. Paste this path into the navigation bar at the top of the editor:  
 `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PasswordLess\Device`
3. Right-click the value called**DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion** , then choose**Delete** and confirm by pressing**Yes** . You can now repeat the above steps.  
![The DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion value highlighted in the Windows 11 registry editor](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-YZozQpXtRzfIaJbTZKstaiJLNs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/registry-editor-passwordless-66acf1099df541fba128680eb6c4af06.png)

## How to Set Up Auto Log in for Domain Scenarios

 You won't be able to configure your Windows computer to use an auto-login in exactly the way described above if your computer is a member of a domain. In a domain login situation, which is common in larger business networks, your credentials are stored on a server run by your company's IT department, not on the Windows PC you're using. This complicates the Windows auto login setup process a little bit, but it's still possible.

 Here's how to get that checkbox from Step 2 (instructions above) to appear so that you can check it:

1. Open Registry Editor by searching for it from the taskbar.
2. From the[registry hive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-hive-2625986) listing on the left, choose[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE](https://www.lifewire.com/hkey-local-machine-2625902) , followed by**Software** .  
![HKEY LOCAL MACHINE SOFTWARE registry editor path](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/irNYI_pfuwf67jcRwZzYP_u5_WM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/registry-editor-local-machine-software-92ed659b15ae4364ae031f0464b627b4.png)  
 If you're in an entirely separate location in the Windows Registry when you open it, just scroll to the very top on the left side until you see _Computer_ , and then collapse each hive until you reach HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE.

3. Continue drilling down through the nested[registry keys](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) , first to**Microsoft** , then**Windows NT** , then**CurrentVersion** , and then finally**Winlogon** .
4. With**Winlogon** selected on the left, locate the[registry value](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-value-2626042) of**AutoAdminLogon** on the right.
5. Double-click_AutoAdminLogon_ and change the_Value data_ to**1** from 0.
6. Select**OK** .  
![AutoAdminLogon Value data 0 in Registry Editor - OK button highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6WXdAG90hh6wKhr228JbWYMRqtM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_how-do-i-auto-login-to-windows-2626066-5bd1118ec9e77c0051169fb2.jpg)
7. Restart your computer and then follow the standard Windows auto-login procedure outlined above.

 That_should_ work, but if not, you may have to manually add a few additional registry values yourself. It's not too difficult.

1. Work back to**Winlogon** in the Windows registry, as outlined above from Step 1 through Step 3.
2. Add the string values of**DefaultDomainName** ,**DefaultUserName** , and**DefaultPassword** , assuming they don't already exist.  
![New string value registry editor option in Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AKZmRwHrLyDWxx-L5J12AqZuAuA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/registry-editor-new-string-value-a458de15ea124fa79e8873f7422ff818.png)  
 You can[add a new string value](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-change-delete-registry-keys-values-2625145) from the menu in Registry Editor through**Edit** \>**New** \>**String Value** .

3. Set the_Value data_ as your**domain** ,**user name** , and**password** , respectively.  
![Screenshot of the Windows 10 registry with DefaultDomainName, DefaultUserName, and DefaultPassword highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_9Nkxmld9oRfhRYMTPwUn6KbJoA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/default-autologin-registry-5ae0f5dfa9d4f900370a9b5b.png)
4. Restart your computer and test to see that you can use the auto login without entering your normal Windows credentials.

## Is It Safe to Auto Log In to Windows?

 As great as it sounds to be able to skip over that sometimes annoying login process when Windows starts, it's not always a good idea. In fact, it may even be a bad idea, and here's why:_computers are less and less physically secure_ .

### Security Risks and Auto Log In

 If your Windows computer is a desktop and that desktop is in your home, which is probably locked and otherwise secure, then setting up automatic logon is probably a relatively safe thing to do.

 On the other hand, if you're using a Windows laptop, netbook, tablet, or another portable computer that often leaves your home, we _highly_ recommend that you don't configure it to automatically log in.

 The login screen is the first defense your computer has from a user who shouldn't have access. If your computer is stolen and you've configured it to skip right over that basic protection, the thief will have access to everything you have on it—email, social networks, other passwords, bank accounts, and more.

### Multiple User Accounts and Auto Log In

 Also, if your computer has more than one user account and you configure an auto login for one of those accounts, you (or the account holder) will need to log off or switch users from your automatically logged-in account to use the other user account.

 In other words, if you have more than one user on your computer and you choose to auto-log in to your account, you're actually slowing down the other user's experience.
