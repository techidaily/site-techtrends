## A Comprehensive Guide to AOL's Famous IM Service: Unveiling the Secrets of AIM
 Introduced in 1997, AOL Instant Messenger was one of the world's most popular instant messaging clients. The free software let users send instant messages to anyone on their "Buddy List," and featured social media integration, photo and file sharing, video and audio chat, and more.

 On December 15, 2017, AIM was discontinued.

 While the instant messaging platform is no longer around, AOL's mail service, sometimes called_AIM Mail_ but officially_AOL Mail_ , is alive and well. You can[log in to AIM Mail here](https://login.aol.com/) using your old AIM username or full AOL email address.

## What Was AIM?

 AIM was a chat service available from desktops, mobile devices, and web browsers that let you instantly communicate with any of your contacts.

![AIM desktop client](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yPwUrCLjIYNkMJqqniYdgAXFPHw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/aim-aol-instant-messenger-463f8beb56de4bcf942fde0bda74f84f-b60c5d8c5602444d977ef4444345343f.png)

 AIM didn't only support one-on-one chats and group IMs. It also allowed you to chat with your Google Talk friends and connected to your social media accounts to show your feeds, trade files, and share location updates.

 If you had an old phone that didn't support the mobile app, you could use the_AIM for TXT_ service to send and receive text messages with your Buddy List through SMS.

 Another way to use it was through AIM Mail (AOL Mail). There used to be chat integration that connected with AIM, letting you view emails and chat messages in one place.

 AOL released other features over the years:

## Why Did AIM Shut Down?

 AOL had this to say in October 2017 about the AOL Instant Messenger shutdown:

> We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997\. Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. Weâ€™re more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.

## AIM Alternatives

 AOL never provided an alternative chat program for AIM, but loads of other apps, services, and desktop programs work in much the same way.

 One intriguing replacement is[AIM Phoenix](https://phoenixim.ddns.net/phoenix/index.php) . It's not affiliated with AOL or Verizon Media, but instead is a server that allows some versions of AIM to work. The site offers client downloads and directions for connecting to the server.

 Other instant messaging applications also work, and they don't involve changing server settings or downloading archived programs. Facebook Messenger is a popular one that works from phones, tablets, desktops, and web browsers. Other examples include WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Snapchat, and Kik. Most of these also function as[apps that can make free calls over the internet](https://www.lifewire.com/free-internet-phone-calls-1356646) .
