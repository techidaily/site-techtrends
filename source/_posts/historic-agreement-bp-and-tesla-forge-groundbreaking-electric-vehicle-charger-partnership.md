## Historic Agreement: BP and Tesla Forge Groundbreaking Electric Vehicle Charger Partnership

BP Pulse, the British Petroleum Companies EV spinoff, just inked a landmark deal with Tesla that's the first of its kind. BP agreed to buy $100 million worth of Tesla Supercharger station hardware to help expand its own DC fast-charging network.

 While BP Pulse already has charging stations and a limited network, this is a huge move to meet its goal of investing nearly $1 billion into EV infrastructure by 2030\. More importantly, it's the first time Tesla is selling its hardware to a third party that'll run on a different charging network. This gives Tesla another revenue stream, yet should benefit the EV market as a whole.

 Tesla has roughly 50,000 charging stations worldwide, compared to just under 28,000 for BP Pulse. Now, the two will work together to expand access for everyone, even though the stations won't look like your typical Tesla Supercharger. Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla's senior director for charging infrastructure, says, _"Selling our fast-charging hardware is a new step for us, and one we're looking to expand."_

 So, what does this mean for your average EV owner? Starting in 2024, BP Pulse will rapidly expand its ever-growing EV charging network with Tesla Supercharger hardware. You'll [find chargers](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-teleport-your-gps-location-on-infinix-hot-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) at various BP-branded locations, including TravelCenters of America, AM/PM, Amoco, Thorntons, and other sites. Soon, EV drivers could have a reason to visit their favorite gas stations again, only to get a charge instead of pumping gasoline.

 Then, the rollout will continue into other locations on the BP Pulse expansion roadmap, like Hertz rental car sites and other dedicated large-scale charging hubs. The first few BP Pulse Superchargers will be deployed in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater Washington DC area.

 BP's Tesla hardware is capable of 250-kilowatt charging and will be [compatible with both](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-undead-uprising-your-essential-compilation-of-zombie-gaming/) Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS) and Combined Charging System (CCS) plugs to support as many vehicles as possible. In closing, along with regular consumers, this move will help BP Pulse deploy chargers at countless private depots for fleet customers. BP Pulse says its industry-leading intelligent charge management software and Tesla's fast and reliable chargers will help deliver a comprehensive charging experience.
