 Dylan (Molly Nutley) wants to dance professionally, but the best gig she can get is cleaning tables at a local drag bar. Fortunately for her, the struggling club needs new queens. The only problem is that she's a girl, which is something she'll have to hide from the patrons and her fellow performers.

_Dancing Queens_ is a clever story about subverting gender norms. Some viewers take issue with a straight woman playing a drag queen, but that's the movie's point: Gender is performance.

 This biographical drama tells the story of Bayard Rustin, a civil and gay rights activist and pivotal organizer of the March on Washingtons for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech at the event.

 The film follows Rustin in his quest to organize the march, highlighting his unflappable determination to be himself and push through the homophobia and racism that threatens to block his path.

_Rustin's_ portrayer Colman Domingo received critical praise for his performance, including an Oscar nod, in this project backed by Higher Ground Productions, the production company founded by Michelle and Barack Obama.
