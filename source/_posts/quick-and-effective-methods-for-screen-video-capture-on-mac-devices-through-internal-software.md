## Two Easy Solutions to Capture Screen Video on macOS

It's estimated that up to 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every 60 seconds, during which video tutorials from screen capture account for a large proportion. Frankly, YouTube is brimmed with virtually any sort of videos that you'll possibly need, from educational tutoring to game walkthrough. In another words, many users are bound up in recording video on Mac for further uploading to YouTube.

To address users' ever increasing needs to capture screen video on Mac OS, this article introduces two easy ways to let you capture video of Mac's display and upload it to YouTube with the help of **QuickTime Player** and **[MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)'s built-in video recorder**. 

### Part 1: Record Screen with Mac' Built-in QuickTime Player

One easy way is the use of QuickTime Player in Mac OS X 10.6 and later as Apple has added display recording feature to QuickTime Player in Snow Leopard. It lets you record the screen of the Mac easily. Below is how to use it to capture screen video on Mac OS X: 

Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player, go and hit File and choose New Screen Recording.

Step 2: Once you finish loading the app, a recording window will pop up. You can click the small triangle button on the right side to set settings before you begin capturing the display video.

Step 3: Press the red button to start recording display activity on your Mac, you will get a hint to ask whether to capture the entire or only a portion of the screen. 

Step 4: Click "Stop" button once you finish activity recording. Then the capture is automatically opened in QuickTime Player as "Screen Recording.mov" which you can then save and use as you'd like. 

### Part 2: Capture Display Video on Mac with Video Screen Recorder

Although QuickTime Player offers screen recording feature, you don't have much control over the recording itself. And the video quality isn't great. While [MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) will definitely meet your requirement. Its built-in video screen capture for Mac enables you to record video taking place on Mac, including videos that non-downloadable online videos, streaming videos, etc with excellent quality.
