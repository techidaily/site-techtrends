## Step-by-Step Fix for Audio Glitches in Your PowerPoint Presentation
 This article will show you how to troubleshoot and resolve audio playback issues in PowerPoint. Instructions apply to PowerPoint 2010 and later and PowerPoint for Microsoft 365.

## How to Fix Audio Problems in PowerPoint

 The following tips will help you get audio playing properly in your PowerPoint presentation. We've arranged them from least to most complicated.

1. Make sure the file format is supported. If you aren't using one of the following supported audio file formats, consider[converting it to a recommended format](https://www.lifewire.com/free-audio-converter-software-programs-2622863) and then reinserting it in the presentation.  
 PowerPoint can use the following file types:  
   * AIFF Audio file,**.aiff**  
   * AU Audio file,**.au**  
   * MIDI file,**.mid or .midi**  
   * MP3 Audio file,**.mp3**  
   * Advanced Audio Codingâ€”MPEG-4 Audio file, .**m4a, .mp4**  
   * Windows Audio file,**.wav**  
   * Windows Media Audio file,**.wma**
2. Check your links. If you link out to audio files, you may not have entered the URL properly. Ensure the links to your files are correct by copying and pasting.
3. Optimize your media. Optimizing your audio media for compatibility is the best way to resolve audio playback issues when you share your PowerPoint presentation.  
 Go to**File** \>**Info** \>**Optimize Compatibility** , and PowerPoint will automatically run the optimization.  
 If**Optimize Compatibility** appears, your media format may have compatibility issues on another device. If it doesn't appear, there are no compatibility issues, and the presentation is ready to be shared.
4. Embed your audio files. Using embeds rather than linking to audio files will guarantee playback. Doing so increases the size of your presentation, but compressing your audio files helps save space.  
 Go to**File** \>**Info** \>**Compress Media** , and then select the audio quality you want. PowerPoint will automatically convert the files.

## Why Doesn't the Audio Work in PowerPoint?

 The main reason for audio issues in PowerPoint is compatibility. If your audio isn't in a format PowerPoint can work with, like FLAC, it won't play right in your presentation.

 You might also have entered an incorrect URL if you've linked the files rather than embedded them.
