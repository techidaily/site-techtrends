 Pros

* Can be used portably or with a TV
* Plenty of great games for kids
* Perfect for couch multiplayer

 Cons

* Not as fast or as advanced as other latest consoles
* Can be quite delicate

 For most kids, the Nintendo Switch OLED is the perfect console to contemplate. Thanks to games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder, it has all the big Nintendo franchises you're likely to have grown up with. Such games are charming and sure to appeal to kids of all ages. Many also have features that mean you can help younger kids figure out what to do. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is also perfect for giving the whole family something to play together and love.

 The console is a little delicate for younger hands but highly versatile. You can use it as a handheld console with its 7-inch OLED screen looking sharp and crisp (if offering lower resolutions than the PS5 or Xbox Series X), but you can also dock it with your TV so the whole family can gather around. You can detach the console's Joy-Con controllers, so you don't need to buy additional controllers for the first two players.

 If you want a games console the whole family can enjoy, the Nintendo Switch OLED is a good choice.

 Pros

* Powerful hardware
* Many great exclusive games
* One of the best controllers

 Cons

* You need to pay for most online multiplayer
* Expensive

 The latest revision of the[ Sony PlayStation 5](https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394) , the[ Sony PlayStation 5 Slim](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-slim-7966360) , is a good console choice for older kids who can play more mature games. Certain games like The Last of Us and God of War franchises are still too old for them (but perfect for you to sneak a go). Still, there are more appropriate games like the Uncharted series or Gran Truism 7 to entertain the kids with fantastic graphics and visual flourishes. 

 The console is straightforward to use, with a straightforward user interface that makes finding what you’re doing simple. Separate from the games is a media section for streaming apps, where you can also watch 4K Blu-rays if you wish. It works well as an all-in-one entertainment unit for the older child in your life. 

 One highlight is the PS5’s DualSense controller, which feels great. With haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, you feel more part of the game than with other regular controllers. I loved swinging through New York City in Marvel’s Spider-Man games; the triggers made me feel more in control. 

 The only downside is that the Sony PlayStation 5 is pretty expensive. Also, if you want to play games online, you’ll need a[ PS Plus membership](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-playstation-plus-4772152) , but popular free-to-play games like Fortnite are exempt from this requirement.

 Pros

* Xbox Game Pass subscription adds incredible value
* Games look great
* Works with Xbox One accessories

 Cons

* Bulky console
* Relatively few true exclusives

 The[ Microsoft Xbox Series X](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-review-one-power-packed-4k-console-5088039)  is the company's most powerful console. It's hefty, so you'll need to find room for it (or you could always opt for the less powerful but much smaller Xbox Series S), but it's sure to be a hit with the kids. Refreshingly, it works with all your older Xbox One accessories, so if you previously owned an Xbox One, you can use the same controllers, headsets, and other extras, which can bring costs down substantially.

Lifewire /Jennifer Allen

 Continuing the backward compatibility trend, the Microsoft Series Xbox X also plays many of the last generation's titles. Buying the Microsoft Series Xbox X means you get a 4K level of detail with your games, with[ Xbox Game Pass](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5077716) the standout option. The service works like Netflix, where you pay a monthly subscription fee to access hundreds of games, with new ones added each month. 

 For children, there are young kid-friendly options like Bluey and Paw Patrol and the Forza franchise to entertain. Exclusives like Halo and Gears of War can be violent for the younger generation.

 Pros

* As comfortable to use as a PS5 controller
* Works with all phones with USB-C port

 Cons

* Still not the same as playing on a real console
* Little flimsy

 Mobile gaming has come a long way in the past few years, with many mobile games being as enjoyable and substantial as console games. That’s where the Backbone One for iPhone 15 Series & Android (USB-C) PlayStation Edition comes in. It is the ideal accessory to solve the awkwardness of using your phone’s touchscreen to control the action. If you’re heading on a trip and want to entertain the kids, hand over your phone and slot this controller accessory onto it.

 Besides hundreds of mobile games, you can also use it to stream from your PlayStation with PS Remote Play or use GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Streaming, extending your gaming options hugely. 

 Two sets of magnetic adapters mean it fits your phone well, while the D-pad and other buttons all feel good under your fingers. It’s also available with the standard ABXY buttons if you prefer. While it isn’t as good as using a regular games console or a dedicated portable device, it’s a relatively inexpensive way of turning your phone into a mobile gaming device when the opportunity arises.

 Pros

* Works with older iPhones
* Choice of models

 Cons

* Not as good as a regular games console
* Not compatible with iPhone 15

 If you have an older iPhone and want to play games more enjoyably, you need the Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning). It works with all iPhones with a Lightning port, so we’re talking the iPhone 14 way back to the iPhone 6s. As with other Backbones, you can connect it to your phone via the magnetic adapters and turn it into a full controller. Pass it to your child while you’re traveling, and they’ll be delighted to play a game more regularly than if they played it solely on the phone.

 As before, the Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning) works with all your iPhone's games. That means Apple Arcade, games purchased on the App Store, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or PS Remote Play. Anything compatible with a controller will work here. It’s much more responsive and enjoyable to use than tapping the screen like you did before, and there’s a choice of models, either the PS way of doing things or ABXY. 

 The Backbone One for iPhone (Lightning) never feels as satisfying as a regular games console. Still, if you want a relatively inexpensive solution or your child will only game occasionally, it’s an excellent way to go compared to buying a new console.

 Pros

* Haptic feedback (vibration) is great

 Cons

* Expensive
* Built-in mic isn’t great

 The PlayStation 5 already has one controller, but if you’re keen to gather the family around, you need to buy an extra Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller. It’s a worthwhile investment to stop the kids fighting over who gets to play next, with many co-op and local multiplayer games available for the PS5\. 

 The Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller is more than just your average controller. It’s far more attractive to use. It has haptic feedback, an upgraded vibration that provides more accurate sensations to whatever you’re doing in-game.

 It also has adaptive triggers, which can change the tension of the rear buttons to make it harder or easier to press in response to your gameplay. 

 You can squeeze it to feel more in control rather than just tapping the trigger buttons to swing something around or accelerate. It’s highly responsive and revolutionizes how gaming feels. In racing games like Gran Turismo 7, it almost means there’s no need for separate driving accessories, as you always feel in control. In games like Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, you can swing around NYC in a hugely satisfying way. 

 The Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controller also has a built-in microphone for when you want to chat with friends while gaming. It’s not as good as a dedicated headset/microphone setup, but it’s a good starting point for the odd occasion your child might be playing with friends. A dedicated share button is excellent for sharing clips and images of what you’re doing, too.

 Pros

* Available in many colors
* Ergonomic design

 Cons

* Uses standard batteries rather than rechargeable

 The Xbox Wireless Controller needs to hurry up and be rechargeable rather than require you to have a pack of batteries ready all the time, but it’s otherwise pretty great. Its design molds into your hands well and is small enough to suit the hands of a child while still feeling comfortable in adult hands.

 Available in many colors, you can soon ensure that every family member has a controller, cutting down on arguments over who gets what. There’s a pretty diverse range of options, too. The controller has the typical triggers and ABXY buttons, but there’s now a dedicated share button, which means you can tap it and then save screenshots or record clips of what’s just unfolded. It’s fun to share your victories or anything humorous that occurs. 

 Pretty much all controllers will pair with your PC, but the Xbox Wireless Controller does so in a much simpler manner than others. So, if you or your kids also play PC games, it works very well as a controller for both PC and Xbox. That’s excellent value for money in a gaming household.

 Pros

* Great sound quality
* Comfortable design
* Many wired connectivity options

 Cons

* Mic could be better
* No app support for consoles

 There are many different gaming headsets around, and it’s essential to pick one that works for your particular console. While they all work with PC and often Switch (if they have a wired connection), you usually need a dedicated solution for PlayStation and one for Xbox. Once you’ve figured that out, give the Logitech G Pro X Wireless a go if you’re a PS4 or PS5 owner. It has a sturdy build but is incredibly comfortable, which isn’t always guaranteed, even with the best gaming headsets. 

 It has a built-in adjustable microphone, which works well, but the highlight is how good the Logitech G Pro X Wireless sounds. Connected via 3.5mm cords or through the included[ USB DAC attachment](https://www.lifewire.com/external-digital-to-analog-converters-3134606) , the Logitech G Pro X Wireless doesn’t take long to set up, and both options prove useful. The 3.5mm option even means you can use it with your Xbox, although we recommend finding a wireless option. 

 However you listen, the Logitech G Pro X Wireless blocks out sound well thanks to its sound isolation functionality. It won’t block out the loudest noises, but your kids will still hear when you call their names for dinner. Ultimately, it’s a good option for ensuring your kids can enjoy some privacy, and you don’t have to keep hearing game sounds.

 Pros

* No need for a dongle
* Comfortable
* Great bass

 Cons

* Sound sometimes lags between console and headset

 For Xbox owners, the Xbox Wireless Headset is a good option for headphones. It’s affordable, so you won’t need to spend hundreds on it, and your kids will still enjoy having their own more immersive experience than relying on TV speakers. Refreshingly, the Xbox Wireless Headset has an equalizer that you or your child can adjust, and it’s all available within the Xbox Accessories app, which you likely already have installed.

 Out of the box, the Xbox Wireless Headset sounds excellent with powerful bass, which lends itself well to the roar of an engine in Forza Horizon 5 or a bracing soundtrack in Halo Infinite. As needed, the Xbox Wireless Headset is comfy, so your child won’t mind wearing it for long periods. It can also handle the occasional toss-around. It can be a little small for adults, but that’s precisely why I like it for a child, as it won’t feel too big for them.

 The Xbox Wireless Headset comes with six months of Dolby Atmos support as standard, which boosts its audio quality. The only downside is that latency can be a little low, i.e., the gap between when the game plays the music and when you hear it. It isn’t huge, so your child probably won’t notice, but if you’re looking for a headset that you will also use, you may find it slightly irritating.

 Pros

* Great force feedback
* Truly immersive steering

 Cons

* Bulky to store
* Pedals can feel stiff

 If your child loves to play racing games and you want them to learn the basics of driving for real, the Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Wheel is a fun and rewarding way to enhance the experience. The set is expensive but has foot pedals, so you get an almost true-to-life driving experience.

 The steering feels great, and the 900 degrees of rotation ensure you're always in complete control. It takes practice compared to using a game controller, but the ergonomics are excellent, and force feedback soon teaches you how to drive effectively. Whether you're playing Gran Turismo 7 or Forza Motorsport, this is a great time. 

 Underneath the wheel are paddle shifters to select manual gears, while the pedals are well-built and provide clutch control and acceleration or braking. The pedals can sometimes be a little stiff, but arguably, so can car pedals. Regardless, if your child is passionate about driving for real, this is the closest opportunity they can grab for a while.

 Got a PlayStation? There's also a[ version for PS5 and PS4](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-motor-Feedback-Responsive-PlayStation/dp/B00Z0UWWYC/?ascsubtag=8414893%7Cn931c995dbd8f41d0b815e59ab721798522%7C&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20) .
