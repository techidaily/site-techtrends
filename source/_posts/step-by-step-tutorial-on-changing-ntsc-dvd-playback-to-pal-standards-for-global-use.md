_Q: We are currently on job duties in Germany. We brought a TV and a DVD player in Germany. We now have the problem that neither the TV nor player is able to display American DVDs and says that playback is prohibited due to region code. We can hear the audio, but for the picture it says "incompatible format". Apparently, this is a PAL / NTSC issue. I don't know why the problem occurs._ 

A: The DVD playback error is due to two compatibility issues: **region coding and NTSC/PAL format**. DVDs and players are region-locked. For instance, the DVD sold in the U.S. uses region 1 code, which won't play on the German player that is region 2 flagged. On the other hand, there are two major DVD formats, namely NTSC and PAL. There will be a compatibility issue if you are trying to play the DVD that uses the NTSC video standard on a player designed with the PAL format. To solve the NTSC [DVD won't play error](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), you need to convert NTSC DVD to PAL video standard without regional restriction.
