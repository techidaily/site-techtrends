## Navigate the Maze of Gmail Archives to Find Your Lost Emails - Tips Inside
### What to Know

* In the search box, enter a unique word or phrase from the missing email. Move it to your**Inbox** when you find it.
* Search the**Spam** ,**Trash** , and**All Mail** folders for emails. Select**More** in the menu to access all folders and tabs.
* The Gmail Message Recovery Tool might also be useful for recovering emails deleted in the last 30 days.

 Whether you accidentally deleted the emails or if they disappeared for some unknown reason, follow these instructions to retrieve your missing Google emails.

## Why Are My Gmail Messages Missing?

 There are a few reasons why Gmail messages may be lost. The most common reason is that you accidentally moved or deleted them, but forwards and filters can also cause emails to disappear.

 This guide applies only if you access Gmail from a web browser. Unique problems could be in play if you're using Gmail in Outlook. For those solutions, check out our[tips for fixing Outlook when it's not receiving emails](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-outlook-not-receiving-email-4177911) .

## How to Recover Missing Emails in Gmail

 There are a few ways to find missing emails. They might have gone to spam, been archived or deleted, or something else.

1. Check your spam. It's possible the missing email was caught by Gmail's spam filter. Select**Spam** from the left menu pane. (You may have to scroll down and select**More** to see it.) If the missing email is in the Spam folder, select the checkbox next to it, then select**Not spam** .  
 Emails marked as Spam stay in the Spam folder for 30 days and then are permanently deleted. Once deleted, you will not be able to access the missing email.
2. Review deleted emails. It's possible your missing email was accidentally sent to the trash. From the left menu pane, select**Trash** or**More** \>**Trash** . If you find the email, right-click it (or[select multiple messages](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-select-multiple-messages-quickly-in-gmail-1172037) if necessary) and choose**Move to inbox** .  
 Emails sent to the Trash folder are permanently deleted after 30 days. If you deleted an email more than 30 days ago, it is gone forever.
3. [Check the All Mail folder](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-retrieve-archived-emails-in-gmail-4165955) . This folder shows everything in your email account, including archived mail and the contents of the Social, Updates, Forums, and Promotions tabs (but excluding emails in Spam and Trash). Click and drag an email to move it to the Inbox folder.
4. [Search for the email](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-search-mail-in-gmail-1172081) . The missing Gmail message might be buried beneath other emails. You can search for anything that might help: the subject, recipient, original sender, date, or body text.  
 Open a specific folder first and then trigger the search if you think you know where the missing email is located.
5. Review your filters if[Gmail is set up to automatically filter incoming messages](https://www.lifewire.com/auto-filter-gmail-messages-1616958) . A filter could block emails, send them to the trash, or move them into folders. This can give the illusion that the emails are missing or deleted when, really, they're just tucked away out of view.  
 It's easy to forget about filters. To see your filters, open Gmail's settings to the**Filters and Blocked Addresses** tab.
6. Check the forwarding account if you're[forwarding emails](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-forward-gmail-email-using-filters-1171934) . This feature lets you automatically send emails to another email account. This means it's possible the other account still has your missing emails.  
 If you're not sure if this is set up for your account, head over to Gmail's settings and select the**Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab. Any forwarding addresses will appear at the top of the screen. Delete those you do not wish to forward to.
7. [Use the Gmail Message Recovery Tool](https://support.google.com/mail/workflow/9317561) . If none of the above tips have worked to find the email, Google's recovery tool could be helpful. Although the service is typically reserved for hacked accounts or when an email has been maliciously deleted, it can sometimes dig up lost emails.

 FAQ

* Why are emails I've moved missing from their folders?  
 There are several causes for previously saved emails to disappear. It could be a device syncing issue or filters accidentally mis-filing or deleting messages. If you share a Gmail account, it's also possible that someone else has moved or deleted those messages accidentally.
* What do I do if my sent emails are missing?  
 Missing sent emails could be caused by a server issue, browser problems, or possibly a filter that's mistakenly deleting messages once they're sent. Try restarting the Gmail or[clearing your browser's cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) first. If it's a server issue, wait for a few minutes or hours and then check again.
