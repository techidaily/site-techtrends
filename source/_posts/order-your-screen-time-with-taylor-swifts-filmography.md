## What Is the Shortcut for Split Screen on Mac?

 Having more than one monitor is essential if you regularly work with multiple windows or apps at the same time on your MacBook Air. However, if you don’t have access to an external monitor, macOS has a built-in solution: Split View.

 Split View (or split-screen view) lets you view two apps or windows side-by-side on your MacBook screen without having to resize them or drag windows around manually. This article teaches you what you need to know about this helpful feature, including how to access it and how to swap between different apps while it’s active.

 To launch Split View, follow the steps below:  

1. Hover your mouse over the**Green Circle** (full-screen button) in the left corner of an open window. A drop-down menu should appear.
