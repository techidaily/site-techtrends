## Comparing iPhones: Should You Upgrade to the Apple iPhone 16 From an Older Base Model? Expert Tips

![Apple iPhone 16 AI Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ac6443a8864f7826f4f08ca3612dae9fe9cbb9b4/2024/09/09/43968368-1e95-45d0-8eb1-ff138d287c07/dsc01879.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

This week, Apple officially unveiled the [iPhone 16 series](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), which consists of the base model, the iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and the 16 Pro Max. Whenever a new generation comes out, there is one question on every iOS user's mind -- is it worth upgrading?

**Also: [Apple just gave me a compelling reason to buy the smaller iPhone 16 Pro over the Max this year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-just-gave-me-a-compelling-reason-to-buy-the-smaller-iphone-16-pro-over-the-max-this-year/)**

[Some would argue](https://www.zdnet.com/article/4-reasons-im-not-upgrading-to-an-iphone-16-pro-from-my-iphone-14/) "not really" because so much of the next-gen smartphone family is still unproven, as impressive as they may be at first glance. The iPhone 16 introduces a subtle yet impactful design change, [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) (gen AI) to the iOS ecosystem, camera updates, and more. People not interested in these updates or on a budget may want to purchase last year's iPhone 15 instead. It's still a great phone.

To help you make this decision, we've broken down all of the most important details for the Phone 15 and iPhone 16 below. We also included a couple of alternatives at the bottom.

##  You should buy the iPhone 16 if...

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. You'd benefit from Apple Intelligence features

Apple is rolling out [multiple AI features to the iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/). Chief among them is the long-awaited Siri upgrade. The iOS assistant is much smarter than before as it is now aware of on-screen content, can better understand commands even if you stumble over your words, and can switch between text and voice inputs. This is just the tip of the iceberg, too, as Siri will fully integrate itself with [ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-the-worlds-most-popular-ai-chatbot-explained/#link={) later in the year.

**Also: [Your AIrPods Pro 2 can soon double as over-the-counter hearing aids. Here's how](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-can-soon-double-as-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-heres-how/)**

There is more to the AI features beyond Siri. Apple Intelligence will be able to summarize notifications and Priority Messages in the Mail app. Like Siri, the feature will be able to understand context. [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/) will gain additional features later in the year like the ability to create custom emojis and perform multiple actions across apps.

###  2\. You want a better photography experience

The [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-compared-which-new-iphone-should-you-buy/) is seeing a new camera array. On the back will be a 48MP Fusion camera serving as the main lens. It'll have a 2x Telephoto option for up-close photography. Apple states it'll be like having "two cameras in one." Alongside it will be a 12MP Ultra Wide lens with an autofocus function that can enable "macro photography." It can also take in "2.6x times more light \[than before\] for higher image quality." 

**Also: [The 5 best iPhone 16 Pro features that enthusiasts will care about](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/)**

On the side below the [Power Button is the new Camera Control](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/). It's a tactile switch with a special sensor that can perform unique actions with a light touch. For example, pressing it quickly launches the Camera app for taking quick snapshots or recording a video. It even introduces a preview feature to help you frame the shot. And if that wasn't enough, it'll work with third-party apps.

###  3\. You want "next-level performance"

Powering the iPhone 16 will be Apple's A18 chipset which the tech giant claims "delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency." Its processor is 30 faster than the iPhone 15's A16 Bionic chip and requires 30 percent less power for the same workloads. The GPU on the iPhone 16 is better too, boasting a 40 percent speed boost over the previous generation.

Gamers, in particular, will appreciate the stronger performance. Apple says players will enjoy higher graphical fidelity and consistent frame rates. The tech giant says the iPhone 16 will house a better battery. At the time of writing, it's unknown what Apple has done to improve the batteries. However, it revealed that it updated the internal design of the iPhone 16 to allow for a larger power source and "to better dissipate heat".

##  You should buy the iPhone 15 if...

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. You don't require the generative AI capabilities

All of the bells and whistles on the iPhone 16 are certainly nice, but are they must-haves? To many people, probably not. Generative AI still has its' issues despite advancing rapidly in the past couple of years. Apple Intelligence and the new Siri may be great, but we wouldn't be surprised to see users encounter performance problems or hallucinations.

**Also: [iPhone 15 review: Why I recommend this model even to 'Pro' users in 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/)**

Sometimes, it's best to wait until all the bugs have been ironed out. Plus, there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding the chipset. Early impressions indicate the A18 can handle all the AI features, but can it? Or will we see a performance drop once it launches?

###  2\. You're on a budget

With the release of a new model, older phones often see a price drop, and that is exactly what we're getting here. Apple has cut the price of the iPhone 15 by about $100 off its digital storefront to entice new adopters. 

It wouldn't be a bad pick-up, either. The camera system of the previous generation is great to this day, the A16 Bionic chip is still plenty powerful, and the Dynamic Island is a welcomed addition. You can enjoy a similar camera performance. Plus, you won't be bogged down by nascent AI features you may or may not ever use.
