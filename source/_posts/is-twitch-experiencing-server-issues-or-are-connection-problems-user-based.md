## Is Twitch Experiencing Server Issues? Or Are Connection Problems User-Based?

Close 

 When[ Twitch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-twitch-4143337) stops working, won't load, or you can't watch your favorite streamers, how are you supposed to know if the service is really down or everyone, or if it's just you? What seems at first like a Twitch outage might be an issue with your web browser, computer, internet connection, or the Twitch[ app](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114) itself if you're viewing on a phone or a streaming device.

 It can be difficult to tell whether Twitch is down or if the problem is on your end, but there are a number of ways to narrow it down and even get Twitch working again if it isn't totally down for everyone.

##  If You See a Twitch Error Message, That Can Help 

 When Twitch fails to load, or you have trouble viewing live streams, you may see an error message. When that happens, try to write down the message. In some cases, the error message will be able to help you figure out if Twitch is down for everyone or just you, and even how to get it working again if that is possible.

 Here are some of the most common error messages seen from Twitch:

* **2000 Network Error** : This error is usually caused by a network error between the streamer and the Twitch servers. If the streamer experiences network problems, you will see this error message. Try reloading or refreshing the stream after a while to see if the streamer's network problems have been fixed.
* **Content not available** : Sometimes seen as**5000 content not available** , this error indicates that the content you're trying to watch isn't available at that time, or that you aren't authorized to view it. The streamer may have restricted viewership to subscribed accounts, they may be streaming at too high of a quality, or there could be an issue with Twitch where the servers aren't able to provide the requested content.
* **Error loading data** : This error occurs when a stream fails to load, or when it cuts out mid-stream. You can try refreshing or reloading the stream, and turning off ad blockers works sometimes, but this problem is often caused by problems on Twitch's end.
* **Sorry. Unless you've got a time machine, that content is unavailable** : This error message can show up for a number of reasons, but it's usually caused by content no longer being available. The streamer may have changed their channel name, or their channel may have been banned. If the error persists, you may need to clear your browser cache and cookies to see the new version of a page.

 If Twitch fails to load, and you don't see any kind of error message at all, there could be sometimes seriously wrong with the Twitch servers or your internet connection. You will usually see an[ HTTP status code](https://www.lifewire.com/http-status-codes-2625907) error at the bare minimum, which indicates a problem with your internet connectivity or the Twitch servers.

 If you don't see any such error message, then check to see if you can view other websites. If you can't, then[ you will have to fix your internet problem](https://www.lifewire.com/cant-connect-to-the-internet-try-this-817794) before you will be able to access Twitch.

 If you do see an HTTP status code when trying to view Twitch, that can actually help you solve the problem. Some of the most common HTTP errors include include[ 500 Internal Server Error](https://www.lifewire.com/500-internal-server-error-explained-2622938) ,[ 403 Forbidden](https://www.lifewire.com/403-forbidden-error-explained-2617989) , and[ 404 Not Found](https://www.lifewire.com/404-not-found-error-explained-2622936) , and there are a number of other[ HTTP status code errors](https://www.lifewire.com/http-status-code-errors-4165131) as well.

##  How to Tell if Twitch Is Down for Everyone 

 If you suspect that Twitch is down for everyone, try these steps to verify that theory:

1. Check the[ official Twitch ingest status page](https://stream.twitch.tv/ingests/) . This page is meant for Twitch streamers, but you can use it to see if the Twitch service is having problems. If the ingest endpoints on this page are offline, that means Twitch is unable to receive data from streamers, so the service will be unavailable until they fix the problem.  
![A screenshot of the Twitch ingest server status site.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EImFowQcFlVuWa8e5waV_vlP8Ak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/twitchingest-db64b3c434ad4ca4a0f10e7ef9807ae0.JPG)  
 This page is hosted on the main Twitch site, so it may not load if Twitch is experiencing server or internet connectivity problems.
2. Check the[ unofficial Twitch Status site](https://twitchstatus.com/) . This site compiles data from a number of official Twitch sources to show whether or not the service is available. If some or all of the services listed on this site are offline, then the problem is on Twitch's end.
3. Search[ X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-exactly-is-twitter-2483331) for[ #twitchdown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitchdown) . Social media sites provide a great source of information when services like Twitch go down. If Twitch is really down, you'll almost certainly find people talking about it on X,[ Facebook](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-3486391) , and other social media sites.  
 The hashtag link above will take automatically take you to a search that displays tweets about Twitch being down, but make sure to click**Latest** to ensure that you see the most recent and relevant tweets instead of old content.
4. Finally, you may want to take advantage of third party service monitor websites. Some helpful status checker sites include:[ Down For Everyone or Just Me](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/twitch.tv) ,[ Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/status/twitch) ,[ Is it Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/twitch.tv.html) ,[ Outage.Report](https://outage.report/twitch) , and[ CurrentlyDown.com](http://currentlydown.com/twitch.tv) .  
![A screenshot of Twitch on Down Detector.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Auq6QICpmhoPc-1bSS7DOLN_3A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/downdetector-5315067eec0f44cd9c6374a0fc13d502.JPG)

##  What to Do When You Can't Connect to Twitch 

 If it looks like Twitch is up and should be working, but you still can't access it, then there's a good chance that the issue is on your end. There could be a problem with your network or[ internet connectivity](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) , and there are a number of things you can check and fix yourself to get Twitch working again.

 Follow these steps, in order, if you suspect that Twitch is currently working for everyone but you:

1. Make sure that you're visiting the real[ Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) site. Before you try any other fixes, try clicking the above link to Twitch. It's a direct link to Twitch, so if that link works, you may have been trying to access a fake or invalid copy of the Twitch site. If that's the case, make sure to update your bookmarks, think about where you may have received the bad link, and immediately change your Twitch password if you attempted to log into the fake site.  
 If you're trying to watch Twitch on your phone or tablet, make sure you have the real app. You can find the[ Twitch app for iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitch-live-game-streaming/id460177396) , and for[ Android devices on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.twitch.android.app&hl=en%5FUS) .
2. Refresh or reload the stream. Once you're sure that you're actually on the official Twitch site, try refreshing the stream. This is especially likely to work if the Twitch site loads just fine, and you were watching a stream, but you now see a frozen image or black box instead of the stream. If there was an interruption to the stream, refreshing or reloading will cause it to start working again.
3. Try a different browser or device. If you're trying to view Twitch through a[ web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-browser-446234) on your computer, try a different web browser or try viewing it on a phone or tablet. If you're already using the Twitch app on your phone, check to see if Twitch works in a web browser on your computer.  
 If you're able to view Twitch through the app or a web browser, but not through both, that means the Twitch service itself is up and running. You may have a problem with your web browser or the Twitch app, or you may have an internet connectivity problem if your phone and computer use different internet connections.
4. Close your web browser if you're trying to view Twitch through a browser. Make sure to completely shut it down by closing every browser window that you have open. After about 30 seconds, open a single browser window and try to access Twitch.  
 Some browsers have hidden processes that don't close when you close your browser windows. When that happens, you may need to restart your computer to fully close the browser.
5. [ Clear your browser cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) if you're trying to watch Twitch through a web browser. Once you have cleared the cache, try to access Twitch again. This is a quick and easy process that won't make any lasting changes to your browser, and it fixes a lot of problems like streaming issues.
6. [ Clear your browser's cookies](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981) . This is another easy fix that can help if you're trying to stream Twitch through your browser. If you have an outdated or corrupt cookie, it can prevent Twitch from loading streams correctly.  
 Clearing your browser cookies can remove custom settings and login information on websites that you use, requiring you to log back in the next time you visit.
7. [ Scan your computer for malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Malware sometimes partially or fully blocks access to the internet to prevent you from finding out how to remove it. If your anti-virus software finds an issue, repair it and then try to access Twitch again.
8. [ Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . If you didn't restart your computer already in an earlier step, do so now. Fully shut it down, don't just put it into sleep or hibernation mode, and then start it back up again and check to see if you can access Twitch.
9. [ Restart your modem and router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . If you're having trouble accessing other sites in addition to Twitch, restarting your network hardware may fix the problem. If it doesn't, contact your internet service provider to see if there is an outage in your area.

##  When Nothing Else Works, Contact Your ISP 

 If you still find that you are unable to view Twitch after going through all of these troubleshooting tips, there's a decent chance that you have some type of internet problem. This is especially true if you were unable to find evidence of Twitch being down for anyone else, and you also have issues loading other sites or streaming content from other services.

 There's a chance that the problem could still be simple, like a poor connection to your[ Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) network, or having too many[ bandwidth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bandwidth-2625809) \-hungry devices connected to your network. In either case, you'll probably need to contact your internet service provider for further assistance.

 This is a much less common issue, but there is a possibility that you may have trouble viewing Twitch due to issues with the path that your internet connection uses to reach the Twitch servers. To rule that you, you may want to try a different [ DNS server](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-server-2625854) . You can[ try changing DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-server-settings-2617979) to one of any number of [ free and public DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062) to see if that might help.
