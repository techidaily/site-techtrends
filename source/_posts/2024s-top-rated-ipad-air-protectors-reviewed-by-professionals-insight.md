[View now at Zugucase](https://www.zugucase.com/products/ipad-air-11-2024-ipad-air-10-9-case-4th-5th-gen-2020-2022)

Pros 
* Adjustable stand
* Bumper and rugged shell
* Magnetic mounting capability
* Front cover
* Stylus holder
* Wireless charging for Apple Pencil
* Great color options
* Under $100

Cons 
* No fun patterns or prints
* A bit bulkier
* Rugged design

## Zugu iPad Air 11 and 10.9-inch Case

### Best iPad Air case overall

Let me start by saying the Zugu iPad Air case is an excellent case that serves as more than a light cover. It features an adjustable stand with eight configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. The Zugu case currently comes in 9 colors, which is more options than other cases on the market. 

When I tested the Zugu case over the last several weeks alongside other options on this list, it was my favorite iPad Air case. It's functional and practical, providing true security from bumps and drops. I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive and features a clean, appealing design. 

While the function is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I have been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don't cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome. Although, I wish there were more fun prints and designs. 

Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is of great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they'd found Zugu sooner. 

What's even better is that Zugu offers a [one-time AppleCare+ repair fee](https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs) if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money as a solid all-around iPad air case for style and protection.

**Zugu iPad Air 11 and 10.9-inch Case features**: Adjustable stand with eight angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep/wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Available in 9 colors | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fees

Pros 
* Fun designs and patterns

* Apple Pencil storage/charging
* Doubles as stand
* Under $100
* Shock absorption
* Raised bezel design

Cons 
* Stand configurations could be more comfortable
* Folio front feels a bit flimsy

## Burga iPad Air Case

### Best basic iPad Air case for style

Suppose Casetify is like your trendy Gen Z coworker who brings fresh designs and innovative features to the table. In that case, Burga is the more sophisticated, sleek, and cohesive millennial with just a few more years behind them. Like Casetify, Burga is extremely popular for iPhone cases, but it's easy to overlook the brand's other protective offerings for devices like the iPad. 

Burga's folio case for the iPad Air combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as a stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. 

Perhaps the best part of Burga's case is that it comes in a slew of designs, patterns, and colors. It's sophisticated but practical and offers enough secure protection for everyday use. 

When I tested the Burga case over the last few weeks, I liked its lightweight feel, Apple Pencil storage, folio-style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It's a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend upgrading to something more secure, such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case, if you're accident-prone or rougher around the edges when it comes to handling your tech. 

I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it's a nice add-on to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92\. 

Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case's design, build, and quality. Many said they enjoyed the fun patterns and color options -- which outdo most other case mentioned on this list in the color department, and compete with the likes of only Casetify. 

**Burga iPad Air Case features:** Raised bezel design for camera and screen protection | Apple Pencil storage and charging spot | Variety of colors and styles | Shock absorbing bumper | Stand configurations | Never-fading prints

### Best versatile iPad Air case

The Moft Snap Float Folio case is one of the most unique iPad Air cases I've tested in the last few months, which doesn't come as a surprise. Moft makes some of the most innovative, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I've seen. 

The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. It also comes with a stylus holder and is configured into three unique angled positions. One standing position is an ultra-high alignment (as pictured), which lifts your iPad higher than most competitors. 

The case is a duo system, with a softer outside folio and a harder case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together and easily removed from each other for quick access. When I tested the Moft case over the last month, I especially liked the standing configuration for my iPad Air, which allowed it to be at eye level. It's perfect for working from home and for video calls.

Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the case's overall design and quality feel, as well as the functionality, thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserve more hype than they get. "It's the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, and the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you're thinking of, and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best. This product should be better known," the customer wrote in their review. 

**Moft Snap Float Folio Case features:** Stylus holder | Three unique stand configurations (one ultra high) | Premium construction and feel | Slim profile | Duo case set | Affordable luxury style

## Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case

### Best iPad Air case with a keyboard

The Logitech Combo Touch is our pick for the best overall iPad Air keyboard case thanks to its top features and more affordable price. The Combo touch is full of function thanks to a detachable keyboard, backlit keys, built-in stylus storage, iPad OS shortcut keys, and more. It offers four modes of use: type, view, sketch, and read, to suit itself for any of your iPad activities. 

**Review: [My favorite iPad keyboard and stylus are not made by Apple](https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/)**

When ZDNET's Senior Reviews Editor Kerry Wan tested the Combo Touch and Logitech Crayon Stylus with the iPad 10th Gen in 2022, he lauded it for its ability to "flex on the Magic Keyboard \[Folio\]." 

"Logitech's Combo Touch cover and Crayon stylus for the iPad are cheaper and practically better than Apple's own accessories. \[They\] are not perfect, but they deliver a more feature-rich experience than Apple's first-party accessories at a fraction of the cost. That's not a knock on Apple's own iPad keyboard and stylus by any means; the two are just as worthy of your consideration," Wan wrote in [his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/). 

Current customers on the Logitech website said they liked the top-of-the-line features, overall value, and price point of the Combo Touch case, which has over 100 5/5 star reviews. One customer, like Wan, even said it beat out Apple's own Magic Keyboard. "This product is exactly what I hoped Apple was going to provide. And, it was at a fraction of the price," they wrote. 

**Logitech Combo Touch features:** 4 modes (type, view, sketch, read) | Detachable keyboard | Backlit keys | Stylus storage | Full row of iPad OS shortcut keys | 1-year limited warranty | Two viewing angles

### Best iPad Air case for durability

Some people use their iPads to scroll on the couch, but others need a tablet in the field. Whether you work in construction, utilities, or another boots-on-the-ground industry, you might want your iPad Air to be able to venture out with you. Enter the OtterBox Defender Series Pro Case. 

With raised edges, it offers drop protection for your screen and camera. Plus, the Defender Series Pro case comes with OtterBox's silver-based antimicrobial additive, which means your case actively fights bacteria growth. Finally, the case offers port covers to ensure any dirt and dust you encounter in the field doesn't clog up your jacks and ports. 

Current users on Best Buy said they like the value, quality, and overall ease of use, giving the Defender case 4.5/5 stars on the site. Many users said they like the secure durability and protection from bumps and scrapes, but some users said they had issues getting their Apple Pencil to stay secure. Plus, new iPad Air 11 and 13-inch Defender series cases will [be available soon](https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/protective-ipad-air-11-inch-m2-case-black/77-95220.html).

## Apple Smart Folio

### Best iPad Air case for Apple lovers

It's hard to beat a case coming straight from the manufacturer. When you choose the Apple-designed Smart Folio for your iPad Air, you're not just guaranteed a perfect fit. You also get functionality that can make it easier to both protect and use your tablet, like the ability to charge your Apple Pencil with the case on. 

The automatic wake/sleep function feature means that whenever you open the case, your iPad Air display automatically wakes up. When you close it, the tablet goes to sleep, saving battery --although you might not need it since the latest generation has up to 10 hours of battery life. 

The Smart Folio attaches to your tablet magnetically. That keeps the design slim and lightweight, but it does leave the edges of your iPad Air exposed to damage if you drop it. It is available for iPad Air 10.9, 11 and 13-inch models in several colors. 

**Also:** **[iPad Air (2022) review: So good I almost regret buying my iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-ipad-air-fifth-generation-review/)**

The cover of the Smart Folio features a tri-fold design that comes in eight color options. That lets you roll it up to serve as a small bump to make it easy to type on the surface of your tablet. Alternatively, you can fold it as a stand to hold the iPad Air almost vertically for easy viewing. 

The main drawback here is the price. This case is not even close to the most affordable cases out there. That said, buying the case straight from Apple can give you peace of mind about fit and functionality -- and can streamline the process since you can purchase it as you buy your iPad Air. Many Best Buy reviewers agree, noting that despite the case's protection, quality, and ease of use, it does have a hefty price tag for a case.

Current Amazon users said they liked the quality, appearance, and fit of the Apple Smart Folio cover. However, some users said it doesn't offer a ton of protection, especially for the high price tag. 

**Apple Smart Folio features:** Auto sleep-wake feature | Magnetically connects to your iPad | Two-stand design

## Factors to consider when choosing an iPad Air case:

If you're in the market for an iPad Air case, here's a few factors to keep in mind: 

* **Size:** It is critical that your iPad case and cover is compatible with your iPad. Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model so it is not too small or too large for your iPad.
* **Build:** iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Air cases and covers incorporate more durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic. Some may even be rated for drop protection, providing an extra level of durability and security for your device.
* **Design:** Why not add a little style to your iPad Air? Many of the best iPad Air cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns, so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry if that's what you're looking for. Make sure to think about what you want for your iPad.
* **Budget:** There are many affordable case options available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on design and features. Set a budget for yourself -- it will help narrow your search parameters.

No, the newest 2024 iPad Air is not the same display size as the previous iteration. The new iPad Air is available in either an 11-inch or 13-inch configuration, while the two previous versions, the iPad Air 5th Gen and 4th Gen, feature a 10.9-inch display. 

This means that if you purchase a new iPad Air, you will need a new case designed for the 11-inch or 13-inch size, or one that stipulates it is compatible with your model. 

## Will iPad Air 10.9-inch cases fit the iPad Air 11-inch model?

The answer is yes and no -- it will depend and vary from brand to brand. Since the launch of the new iPads this year, I've noticed several brands have cases that will work in tandem with both the iPad Air 10.9 and iPad Air 11, while others have separated the two. 

If you already have a 10.9-inch case, it won't hurt to try it on your iPad Air 11-inch and see if it works, but keep in mind that for the best protection, we recommend outfitting your iPad Air in a case that specifically stipulates that it was designed for your particular display size. An ill-fitting case will not provide the same protection as one that properly fits.

## Are the iPad (2022) and the iPad Air (2022) the same size?

The 2022 iPad and iPad Air iterations do both offer a 10.9-inch screen display, as well as similar Liquid Retina displays. 

## What are the iPad Air sizes?

The 4th and 5th Gen iPad Air models have a 10.9-inch display, and the latest iPad Pro models have either an 11-inch or 12.9-inch display (iPad Pro 11-inch 4th Gen or iPad Pro 12.9-inch 6th Gen). The new iPad Air and iPad Pro models both come in an 11-inch or 13-inch display. You can compare sizes and see display and model information on the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-air-3rd-gen,ipad-air-5th-gen,ipad-10th-gen). 

## Do I really need a case for my iPad Air?

You put a case on your smartphone, so why wouldn't you put a case on your tablet? Cases and covers ensure the device you spent money on is protected through travels, everyday bumps and bangs, and potential scratches. 

Investing in a good iPad Air case is investing in your iPad Air. 

## Do I need an iPad Air keyboard case?

The answer here boils down to how you want to use your iPad Air. If you frequently use your iPad like a mini computer setup to do work, school, or other typing and stylus-driven activities, a keyboard case could be a great option for you -- especially if you want to optimize your iPad and upgrade how you can use it. 

If you just use your iPad Air for entertainment like catching up on your favorite TV show, an expensive keyboard case is probably not worth your investment. 

## Do all iPad Air cases come with a stand?

While it's not a hard-and-fast rule that an iPad Air case must include a stand, the vast majority of the products on the market today do. If a stand is a feature you aren't willing to compromise on, be sure to use that as a way to narrow your search parameters. 

## If I buy a case from a company other than Apple, will it fit?

The trick here is confirming that you're buying a case designed to fit the generation of iPad Air that you've purchased. If you bought the 2020 4th Generation Air, it will fit cases for the 2022 5th Generation iPad Air and vice versa. Both the 4th and 5th Gen iPad Airs have the same dimensions and the same button and camera placements. 

Just be sure not to accidentally purchase cases designed for other iPad models and display sizes. Reading the specs and features before finalizing your purchase can help avoid any unnecessary or incorrect purchases. 

## Will the case make my iPad Air waterproof?

None of the cases we've discussed here will make it safe to dunk your iPad Air. What's more, you'll be hard-pressed to find a reputable waterproof iPad Air case on the market today, especially for 4th and 5th Gen tablets. 

It's also worth noting that Apple doesn't build in the same level of water resistance as many people might expect. While their later-model iPhones generally offer some water resistance, they make no such claim with their iPad Air. Long story short, your new tablet and water don't mix. 

## Where can I find iPad Air cases?

Most major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon have several iPad Air cases for sale in-store and online. If you're looking for more bespoke brands, such as Casetify, you may have to look directly on those individual retailers sites to see their iPad Air case offerings. But don't fret -- starting your search at ZDNET is always a good decision. 

## Are there alternative iPad Air cases to consider?

Yes, there are tons of iPad Air cases on the market, each with different offerings. While we rounded up some of our top picks above, here's some other great options you can consider.

## Casetify Impact Case

When I tested the Impact case on the iPad Air I liked its light weight, handy Apple Penil storage, and numerous prints and designs. It's a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but there's no screen protection (unless you upgrade to the folio style). And it's quite pricey.
