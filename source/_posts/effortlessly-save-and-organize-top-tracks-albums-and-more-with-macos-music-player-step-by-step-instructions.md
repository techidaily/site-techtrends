 As you mark tracks as favorites, the Music app automatically adds them to the built-in "Favorite Songs" playlist, accessible from the sidebar. You cannot disable or delete this playlist from your library.

 By default, songs you've marked as favorite are automatically added to your library. This can lead to unwanted storage consumption if the Automatic Downloads feature is enabled. To favorite songs without adding them to the library, go to Music > Settings > Advanced, uncheck "Favorites" beneath "Add Songs to Library When Adding To", and click "OK."

##  How to Filter Your Music Library to Only Show Favorites

 For more focused browsing, filter out everything but your favorites from the library. To begin, select a playlist or any item below "Library" in the sidebar. Click the three horizontal line button in the top-right corner and choose "Only Favorites" from the menu.

![Filtering the library in Music for Mac to only show favorites.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/apple-macos-sonoma-14-3-music-app-sidebar-albums-selected-filter-menu-only-favorites-option-highlighted.png) 

 You can sort songs and playlists (but not albums or artists) in your library by favorites by going to View > Sort By > Favorites.

 Whenever you see a highlighted star icon anywhere within Music, it indicates you've marked the item as a favorite.

![Music for Mac with Songs selected in the sidebar and tracks on the right, with some showing the favorites star icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/apple-macos-sonoma-14-3-music-app-sidebar-songs-selected-favorite-star-icon-visible.png) 

 Unfortunately, the tiny star icon is easy to miss. To help with that, consider [creating individual smart playlists](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/how-to-successfully-obtain-anker-mouse-compatibility-drivers/) of your favorite artists, songs, and albums to access them quickly.
