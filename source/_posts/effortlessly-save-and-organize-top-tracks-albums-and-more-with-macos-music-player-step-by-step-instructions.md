##  How to Filter Your Music Library to Only Show Favorites

 You can sort songs and playlists (but not albums or artists) in your library by favorites by going to View > Sort By > Favorites.

 Whenever you see a highlighted star icon anywhere within Music, it indicates you've marked the item as a favorite.
