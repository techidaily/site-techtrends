 Have you ever got hooked on a song that you wanted to revisit later without necessarily adding it to your library? The Music app on your Mac lets you mark tracks, albums, artists, and playlists as your favorites—doing so lets you quickly find them and influence future recommendations.

##  How to Favorite an Artist in Music for Mac

 Click the "Artists" section in the sidebar, select an artist in the next column, and press the star icon to the right of their name. Alternatively, click the ellipsis and select "Favorite."

 If you subscribe to Apple Music, you'll receive a notification when your favorite artists release new music.

 As you mark tracks as favorites, the Music app automatically adds them to the built-in "Favorite Songs" playlist, accessible from the sidebar. You cannot disable or delete this playlist from your library.

 By default, songs you've marked as favorite are automatically added to your library. This can lead to unwanted storage consumption if the Automatic Downloads feature is enabled. To favorite songs without adding them to the library, go to Music > Settings > Advanced, uncheck "Favorites" beneath "Add Songs to Library When Adding To", and click "OK."

##  How to Filter Your Music Library to Only Show Favorites

 For more focused browsing, filter out everything but your favorites from the library. To begin, select a playlist or any item below "Library" in the sidebar. Click the three horizontal line button in the top-right corner and choose "Only Favorites" from the menu.

 You can sort songs and playlists (but not albums or artists) in your library by favorites by going to View > Sort By > Favorites.

 Whenever you see a highlighted star icon anywhere within Music, it indicates you've marked the item as a favorite.

 Unfortunately, the tiny star icon is easy to miss. To help with that, consider [creating individual smart playlists](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/how-to-successfully-obtain-anker-mouse-compatibility-drivers/) of your favorite artists, songs, and albums to access them quickly.
