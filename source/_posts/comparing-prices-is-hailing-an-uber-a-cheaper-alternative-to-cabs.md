### Navigate to the Charging Station  

 On a long trip, you should always add a charging station to your route before you begin your journey. It can help you optimize your route, even though you can search and divert to a charging station anytime.  
 On the**Explore** screen, choose the filter icon and set Google Maps to display charging stations by**Relevance** ,**Distance** ,**Rating** , type of**EV plugs** , and**EV charging speed** .  
 You can even change them on the fly to expand your options when the pins are displayed on the map.  
 Tap the icon of an EV charging station for details like charging speeds (kW), real-time availability (if provided by the station), and user photos. If it's an option, check out the Street View to familiarize yourself with the approach.
