## The Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Gameplay Performance in Windows 1Nvite Gamers to Conquer with Optimized Settings

It’s important to optimize your Windows 10 operating system if you want a best gaming experience. You should make sure your system runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible and it won’t bother you when you’re playing your games.

## To optimize your Windows 10 computer for gaming

 The following are a few methods that have helped many Windows 10 users have better gaming experiences. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Limit your startup items**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Configure your power plan**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your system**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Temporarily pause Windows Update**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Disable your visual effects**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [**Upgrade your computer hardware**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Limit your startup items

 Startup items mean the programs or processes that run automatically when your operating system starts. They can affect your Windows 10 system and your game performance. You should check these items and disable the ones you don’t need.

 This will only stop those items from running automatically at startup. You can still open these programs or services.

To do so:

**1)** Right click any empty space of the taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .

**2)** Click the**Startup** tab, then disable the items you don’t need.

 If you’re not sure what an item is, do some research on the Internet to know what it is and if you can disable it.

 To disable a startup item, right click this item and click**Disable** .

 The next time you start your Windows 10 system, the items you disabled won’t start automatically.

### Method 2: Configure your power plan

 You can’t release the full power of your Windows 10 system if you’re using a energy saving power plan. To optimize your device, you should check your power settings and change your power plan for better performance. Here’s how to do it.

**1)** Right click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of your screen, then click**Power Options** .

**2)** Click**Additional power settings** .

**3)** Make sure the_Power saver_ plan is NOT chosen.

 You can choose the**High performance** plan for better performance. But if you want a longer battery life, it’s recommended that you choose the**Balanced** plan.

### Method 4: Temporarily pause Windows Update

 Pausing updates from being installed prevents Windows Update from installing updates when you’re in the middle of a game (which is quite frustrating). Here’s how to do it.

 Note that you should resume your update installation if you have time. It’s crucial for your system security.

**1)** Press the**Windows logo key** and**Q** on your keyboard and type “_update_ “. Then click**Check for updates** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3ee66e073eb.jpg)

**2)** Click**Advanced options** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3eea6be5120.jpg)

**3)** Turn on**Pause updates** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b3eeac6985cd.jpg)

 Windows Update will be paused for up to 35 days. And after you resume it, you’ll only be able to re-pause it after you install the latest updates.

### Method 5: Disable your visual effects

 Windows 10 has a lot of fancy visual effects, but they sometimes consume a large amount of system resources. If you don’t need those effects, you should disable them to make your computer run faster.

**1)** Press the**Windows logo** key and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the_Run_ box.

**2)** Type “_sysdm.cpl_ ” and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

### Method 6: Upgrade your computer hardware

 Hardware component upgrade is always the most effective optimization method, if you have enough budget. The following are the components you should consider upgrading first:

* **RAM (memory).** Adding more memory to your computer increase the speed of your program and the number of tasks your operating system can do at a time. To add RAM, install new memory on your computer (it must be the same model as your own). Or replace your memory module with the one that has more memory.
* **Hard drive.** Use a larger hard drive for more disk space for your Windows 10 system. Or use an SSD instead for faster speed.
* **Graphics card.** If you’re optimizing your Windows 10 system for gaming, you should always check your graphics card. Installing a better dedicated graphics card always improve your game performance. (Note that you might need to replace your power supply at the same time due to the increased power consumption.)
