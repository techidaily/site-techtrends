## How Can You Access ESPN+? 

 Access ESPN+ on a mobile device by downloading the ESPN app for[ iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/espn-live-sports-scores/id317469184) or[ Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espn.score%5Fcenter) , and then upgrading to ESPN+ as an in-app purchase. For viewing on a TV or computer,[ get ESPN+ via the ESPN app or channel on a Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-espn-plus-on-roku-7485522) , Apple TV, Chromecast, or Amazon Fire TV streaming device, or via a Samsung Smart TV. Or, watch in a web browser, on an Xbox, PlayStation, and more.

 There's no need for a cable subscription to sign up for ESPN+, but real sports fans might not want to completely sever the cord just yet, as ESPN+ doesn't allow access to NBA or NFL games or marquee events on other channels.

 Visit ESPN for a complete list of the[ devices that support ESPN+](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/sections/13616855809684-Supported-Devices) as well as help for setting up the app.

## What Does ESPN+ Get You? 

 ESPN+ has an impressive array of mainstream and eclectic sports content. Watch live Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, and Major League soccer games, as well as some college sports, PGA golf, boxing, and tennis matches.

 If you're a UFC fan, you'll get access to special events, exclusive matches, and pay-per-view events that aren't accessible anywhere else. If you're a fan of less mainstream sports, you'll enjoy rugby, cricket, games from the Canadian Football League, and other international sports.

 Aside from live games and matches, access written articles, sports podcasts, news, score updates, fantasy football information, original programming, condensed versions of ESPN's SportsCenter recap and the NFL Prime Time series, and a library of documentaries and other on-demand content.

## How Much Does ESPN+ Cost 

 ESPN+ costs $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year. It's also included in a basic bundle with Hulu and Disney Plus for $14.99 per month (all with ads), as well as in a premium bundle for $24.99 per month (Disney+ and Hulu without ads). If you're a sports fan, paying around $110 per year to get access to such a wide swath of sporting content just might be worth it. If you're a UFC fan, it's almost a no-brainer.

 While ESPN+ won't fulfill all your sporting needs, with no NFL or NBA games, it's an excellent add-on to your sporting media options.
