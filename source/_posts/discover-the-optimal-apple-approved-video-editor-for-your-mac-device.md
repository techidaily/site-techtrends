### Method 1: Disable startup programs

 Startup programs start automatically when your PC turns on. They’ll run in the background and hog your PC resources.

 So, if you have multiple auto-start programs, you are likely to run into the slow boot issue, and your laptop may also require more time to respond due to overloading. To fix this issue, follow the instructions below to ditch unwanted startups:

* **[Disable startup programs on Windows 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Disable atartup programs on Windows 8 &10](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**Disable startup programs on Windows 7**

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**msconfig** . Then, select**msconfig** .

**What is Disk Cleanup?**
 Disk Cleanup is a Microsoft built-in utility that allows you to get rid of the temporary and unnecessary files on your laptop.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**disk cleanup** .

### Method 7: Update drivers for your devices

 One of the most common causes of the performance lag on your laptop is outdated or faulty device drivers. It’s essential that you have the latest correct drivers for your hardware devices. There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your devices: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update drivers manually by going to the manufacturer website for each of your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-17_12-11-59.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update button** next to the driver you want to update to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-10-17_12-12-06.jpg)

### Method 9: Use Fortect to Optimize Your System

 Over time, the performance of your laptop can decrease due to all kinds of problems, for example, malware, broken system data, etc.

 While some people might choose a clean reinstall of the system to either replace corrupted system files or get rid of problematic old files, it requires time and computer techniques to do so.

 If you don’t feel like going through all the trouble reinstalling the system, you can use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to run a free scan on your computer. This will analyze various aspects of your computer, including security issues, stability issues, and broken registry files that require repair.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and run a free scan. This might take 3\~5 minutes to fully analyze your PC. Once complete, you will be able to review the detailed scan report.

 3) You’ll see the summary of detected issues on your PC. Click **START REPAIR** and all the issues will be fixed automatically.
