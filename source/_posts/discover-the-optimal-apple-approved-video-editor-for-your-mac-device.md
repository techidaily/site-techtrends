 So, if you have multiple auto-start programs, you are likely to run into the slow boot issue, and your laptop may also require more time to respond due to overloading. To fix this issue, follow the instructions below to ditch unwanted startups:

* **[Disable startup programs on Windows 7](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 4: Defragment your hard drive

 Defragmenting rearranges the layout of files on your hard disk. It’s a process to help make accessing the files on your disk faster. To see if defragmenting your drive can improve your laptop’s performance, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**defragment** .

**2)** Select**Defragment and Optimize Drivers** if you’re on Windows 8/10\. (If you’re on Windows 7, select**Disk Defragmenter.** )

### Method 7: Update drivers for your devices

 One of the most common causes of the performance lag on your laptop is outdated or faulty device drivers. It’s essential that you have the latest correct drivers for your hardware devices. There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your devices: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update drivers manually by going to the manufacturer website for each of your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
