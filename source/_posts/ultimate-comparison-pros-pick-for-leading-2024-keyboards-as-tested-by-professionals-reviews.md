## Logitech MX Keys S Wireless Keyboard

### Best keyboard overall

**Logitech MX Keys S Wireless Keyboard specs: Type:** Full size **| Wired/Wireless:** Wireless **| Number of keys:** 104 **| Dimensions:** 17.8 x 5.83 x 1.73 inches

Logitech's new MX Keys S builds on the successes of ZDNET's former best keyboard pick by integrating improved software features like Logi Options+ support and what Logitech calls Smart Actions. Smart Actions, as tested in ZDNET's review, allows users to map routines and keystroke sequences to single keys on the board. 

That means that with a bit of plugging and playing, you can program dedicated keys to crop and edit videos faster, instantly zoom in on a photo and switch to a desired brush on Photoshop, or even populate ChatGPT answers based on highlighted text. Smart Actions alone takes the original Logitech MX Keys to a whole other level.

**Review: [Logitech MX Keys S](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/my-favorite-logitech-keyboard-just-got-a-major-upgrade-and-chatgpt-users-will-love-it/)**

Royal Hernandez, Founder at [StarAndLink](https://www.starandlink.com/), says of all of the keyboards his team has tried, the Logitech MX Keys Wireless Keyboard is the favorite. "You can use it with a Windows or Mac computer, and it features a snappy mechanical keyboard with a full number pad, arrow keys, and function keys -- some of which are labeled in two ways. It has a variety of switch types, including tactile for silent typing, clicky for a pleasant action, and linear for a less jarring experience."

The keys light up as you begin, thanks to intuitive backlighting, and the intensity of it can now be adjusted via companion software. This keyboard also features PerfectStroke keys that are made to fit the tips of your fingers for a more comfortable and efficient fit.

This Bluetooth keyboard is compatible with several systems and can be paired with three devices at the same time.

## Apple Magic Keyboard

### Best keyboard for Mac users

**Apple Magic Keyboard specs: Type:** Full size **| Wired/Wireless:** Wireless **| Number of keys:** 78 **| Dimensions:** 11.5 x 5 x 0.8 inches 

The Apple Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard for Apple users, offering what Bram Jansen, chief editor and co-founder of [VPNAlert](https://vpnalert.com/), calls "the coziest, most dependable, and most attractive keyboard we've ever had the pleasure of using."

He continues, "It has a terrific bounce and delightful tactile feedback when we're typing for extended periods of time. Its snappy Touch ID reader, which performs fantastically, and its month-long battery life are further characteristics we adore. And it's so simple to use."

The Apple Magic Keyboard uses a stable scissor mechanism positioned under each key for an incredibly responsive and comfortable typing experience. This 78-key keyboard is made to work with a variety of Apple devices, including your iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer. With Bluetooth and USB-C capability, it connects to known devices automatically, so you can get to work that much faster. With a lightweight design, it is easy to tote around, too.

### Best gaming keyboard

**Corsair K100 RGB Keyboard specs: Type:** Full size **| Wired/Wireless:** Wired **| Number of keys:** 110 **| Dimensions:** 19.3 x 3.2 x 9.4 inches

If you are a gamer, the Corsair K100 RGB Keyboard is likely to be the best keyboard for you. That doesn't mean that everyday users won't appreciate the extra features. 

**Review** **:** [**Corsair K100 RGB Keyboard**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/corsair-k100-rgb-gaming-keyboard-review/)

The Corsair K100 RGB Keyboard gives a powerful response, thanks to Corsair Axon Hyper-Processing Technology that provides 4,000Hz polling and 8 megabytes of onboard storage. Meanwhile, iCUE software lets you customize your control wheel and RGB lighting for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It is comfortable, too, with a detachable palm rest made of memory foam for those long hours at work.

**Razer Pro Type Ultra Keyboard specs: Type:** Mechanical **| Wired/Wireless:** Wireless **| Number of keys:** 104 **| Dimensions:** 19.17 x 8.82 x 3.23 inches 

If you hate the loud clickety-clack of traditional keyboards, you are sure to love the Razer Pro Type Ultra Keyboard for its silent keys.

Anthony Buzzetta is the CEO & Founder of AI & tech company [G Tier](https://gtier.com/generative-ai/), where he shares over 23 years of professional tech experience. He tells me, "I never was a huge fan of mechanical keyboards, but this one won me over. I've been using the Razer Pro Type Ultra Keyboard for a few months and I'm really happy with it. It's got a nice clean design, it's comfortable and the battery lasts a long time," he says.

## How did I choose these best keyboards?

In my search for the best keyboards, I considered several different factors. 

* **Operating system:** Some keyboards only work with certain operating systems, such as Windows only or limited to Mac computers. Be sure to confirm that your chosen keyboard is compatible with the type of computer you plan to use.
* **Size:** There are different types of keyboards that you can buy. Compact keyboards are often at a 60%, 68%, or 75% size, while tenkeyless keyboards come in an 80% package. There are also full-size and ergonomic keyboards, like the ones seen here.
* **Connectivity:** There are both wired and wireless keyboards available, depending on your preference.
* **Price:** The cost of keyboards can vary significantly, depending on the model and brand that you choose. For example, the Razer and Corsair models will cost you significantly more than the Apple keyboard.

## What size keyboard should you buy?

There are a few different types of keyboard sizes from which to choose. 

* **Full-size:** This type includes a total of 104 keys and includes a numpad (or number pad). It is ideal for those who frequently work with numbers.
* **Compact form factor:** Also known as a tenkeyless keyboard, this keyboard does not include a numpad but does still offer the arrow and function keys traditionally associated with it. It is an ideal fit for those who want a more compressed feel and do not often use numbers in their daily typing.

"As for the keyboard size, it depends on what you like and how you'll use it," advises Rosenfeld. "Some people want a compact keyboard that's easy to carry around, while others might need a full-size keyboard with a built-in number pad for ease of use."

Buzzetta agrees, saying it's up to user preference, "You want to take into consideration the size of your hands, the size of your desk space, and what you're comfortable with. It's like a car," he explains, "You really gotta test drive it to get the complete feel."

## Should I buy a wired or wireless keyboard?

Rosenfeld offers his advice, saying, "Wireless keyboards give you more freedom and help keep your desk clutter-free. But some folks might like the stability and reliability of a wired connection better."

Buzzetta adds, "Wired keyboards are slightly more responsive and are the best when it comes to input lag. They're also good if you want to avoid batteries," he explains. "Wireless is preferable if you want to get rid of wires or want freedom of mobility. Another consideration is cost, \[as\] wireless tend to run higher than wired."

When picking between a wired or wireless keyboard, it's really up to you, says Rosenfeld. 

## How much do the best keyboards cost?

The cost of keyboards can really run the gamut based on factors like manufacturer, size, type, and features. However, we found that the best keyboards that you can buy range in cost from $83 to $185, depending on the brand and model that you choose. 

## Are there alternative best keyboards worth considering?

Logitech is one of the best keyboard manufacturers that you can choose from for your new keyboard. We found many top-rated models that users love, including these models, that may also be a great fit for you.
