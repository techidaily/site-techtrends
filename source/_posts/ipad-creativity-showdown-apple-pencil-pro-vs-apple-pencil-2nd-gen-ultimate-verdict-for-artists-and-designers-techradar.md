Apple debuted the first Apple Pencil in 2015, the [Apple Pencil 2nd Gen](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMU8F2AM%2FA%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation%3Fafid%3Dp238%257CsoUUyt6Eu-dc%5Fmtid%5F1870765e38482%5Fpcrid%5F698835948708%5Fpgrid%5F76054338126%5Fpntwk%5Fg%5Fpchan%5F%5Fpexid%5F%5Fptid%5Fkwd-555089967735%5F%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-btb-applepencil--slid---product-&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) in 2018, and the [USB-C Apple Pencil](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMUWA3AM%2FA%2Fapple-pencil-usb-c%3Fafid%3Dp238%257Cs1FP1kPGr-dc%5Fmtid%5F1870765e38482%5Fpcrid%5F698835948672%5Fpgrid%5F164849171969%5Fpntwk%5Fg%5Fpchan%5F%5Fpexid%5F%5Fptid%5Fkwd-1922716275261%5F%26cid%3Daos-us-kwgo-btb-applepencil--slid---product-&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) in November 2023\. iPadOS 17.5 [hinted](https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/02/squeeze-gesture-apple-pencil-3/) at a new "squeeze" gesture for the company's third Pencil iteration that would allow users to perform more tasks more quickly. Today, those [rumors](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-pencil-3-8584088) were confirmed. 

The new [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro) offers several upgraded features designed in tandem with the newly announced iPad Pro models, including a squeeze function to switch between tools, colors, and line weights; a gyroscope barrel roll for precise brush and pen control; and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse. 

Plus, if you're always misplacing your stylus, the Apple Pencil Pro features Apple's native Find My technology.

##  You should buy the Apple Pencil Pro if...

Apple

###  1\. You need the enhanced functionality

Are you a creator or developer who uses your iPad for advanced photography, videography, graphic design, and editing? The Apple Pencil Pro is packed with new upgrades designed to enhance and functionally upgrade your creative experience, especially when used with the new iPad Pro. 

The Pencil Pro steps up the low latency and pixel-perfection of the Apple Pencil (2nd Gen), and expands its range of features to include a squeeze gesture for quick tool, color, and other changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pens and brush tools with a simple rotation, and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse. Plus, Apple Pencil hover lets you know exactly where your Apple Pencil will touch down on your display for greater precision. 

**Also: [iPad Pro (2024) vs. iPad Air (2024): Which Apple tablet should you buy?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-vs-ipad-air-2024/)**

The Pencil Pro steps up the low latency and pixel-perfection of the Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) and adds features like the squeeze gesture, gyroscope, and custom haptic feedback. Plus, Apple Pencil hover lets you know exactly where the pencil will touch down on your display for greater precision. 

In contrast, Apple Pencil 2 has a double-tap gesture that lets users switch tools, but no "squeeze" gesture support. Also, it supports Apple Pencil hover only when used with the new iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) and iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation). If you're planning to upgrade your iPad for creative work, an upgrade to the new Apple Pencil Pro makes sense.

###  2\. You misplace your tech gear

If you frequently misplace your tech and -- specifically -- your iPad accessories, the Apple Pencil Pro incorporates Apple's native Find My technology, which means you'll be able to track your stylus easily. 

The Pro is the only stylus in Apple's lineup to offer this feature. For individuals who misplace their tech often, it's truly a game changer.

###  3\. You plan to buy the newest iPads

The Apple Pencil Pro was designed hand in hand with the newest iPad Pro and upgraded software. If you're making the jump to a new M3 iPad Air or M4 iPad Pro, buying the Apple Pencil Pro makes sense, since its advanced features leverage the chip and AI technology incorporated into Apple's new tablets. If you're looking to get the most productivity, functionality, and value out of your new iPad, we think it's wise to invest in a tool designed to maximize your new iPad's capabilities.

###  1\. You want to save some cash

The Apple Pencil (2nd Gen) usually retails for $129, but throughout sale periods like Presidents' Day and Cyber Week, we've seen it drop to just $79\. In fact, it's [currently on sale for $79](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-white%2F6252354.p%3F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) at several retailers following today's announcement of the new Apple Pencil Pro.

If you're looking for a wallet-friendly pick, the 2nd-Gen Pencil offers advanced features such as low latency, tilt sensitivity, and palm-rejection technology. Plus, it's likely the 2nd-Gen will see more frequent sales or steeper discounts throughout the latter half of this year, thanks to its new sibling. 

### 2\. You want to upgrade your iPad, but not your stylus

Maybe you're ready to upgrade your iPad, but don't want to shell out the extra cash for the new Apple Pencil Pro -- there's good news. Apple announced that new iPad models will still support the older Apple Pencil (2nd Gen), giving users two stylus options to choose from. 

So if you're not looking to upgrade your stylus accessory too (or you want to save a few dollars and skip out on the new model) you don't need to purchase the new Apple Pencil Pro -- unless you're looking to buy a new iPad Pro.
