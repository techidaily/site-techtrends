## Customer Testimonials

![](https://www.macxdvd.com/mpeg-video-converter-free/../image/customer-ico.jpg) 

After using this software for a couple of days, I must admit that this is really a useful video tool for me. I am so satisfied to find it able to convert the video from my Sony HD camcorder and now I have got a video chip of it in my iPhone and the video effect is surprisingly crisp. Thanks for your job to develop the software.
