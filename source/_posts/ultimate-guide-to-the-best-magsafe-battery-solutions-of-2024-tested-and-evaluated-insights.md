## What's the best MagSafe battery pack right now?

I and other ZDNET experts went hands-on with several of the top MagSafe battery packs (including every pick on this list), spending time testing for charge speed, function, and other features during our everyday activities. Our tested pick for the best overall MagSafe battery pack is currently the newly refreshed [Belkin BoostCharge Pro Qi2 battery](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHRE92ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge%25E2%2584%25A2-pro-magnetic-power-bank-5k-magsafe-compatible%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C159047%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir-159047&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) thanks to its upgraded design and refined functionality.

Pros 
* Qi2 charging
* Minimal warming
* Kickstand to prop phone
* Fits snug on iPhone
* Several color options
* Strong magnetic grip
* Recently upgraded design
* Clear battery indicator lights

Cons 
* Fun colors only sold by Apple
* Not the sleekest option

## Belkin Boostcharge Pro Qi2 Magnetic Power Bank 5k

### Best MagSafe battery pack overall

Let me start by saying that I really liked the first iteration of this battery pack (enough to have it included on this list over the last several months) and I like the newly upgraded Qi2 version even more (so much so that the BoostCharge has just boosted its way to the top of this list). 

This new model has the USB-C connector on the side instead of the bottom of the pack, making it easier to use your phone standing upright while the pack is charging. Instead of the charging indicator lights being on the side, they're now more visible, located on the back of the pack. This model is also a tad slimmer and lengthier than its predecessor, making it easier to transport. 

**Also:** [**My new favorite MagSafe battery pack supports Qi2 charging, has a kickstand, and isn't made by Anker or Baseus**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-new-favorite-magsafe-battery-pack-supports-qi2-charging-has-a-kickstand-and-isnt-made-by-anker-or-baseus/)

And while this Belkin pack is a true embodiment of a classic brick-style battery booster, there is still a place in my heart for it because it just works so well. Similarly to many picks on this list, it provides 5,000mAh of extra juice to your phone, which is a standard capacity for many MagSafe packs. Its design, though simple, fits snugly against my phone (no bumping onto the lip of my camera lens) and remains secure. Often, you'll see some gapping between the battery and the phone due to a disturbed magnetic connection, but not with this Belkin battery pack. 

Its secure grip and competitive battery speak for themselves. I took this pack to a Yankees game, to several late-night outings, to work, and even on errands, and I am impressed with the charging. You can expect between a 25-30% battery boost in about an hour to your phone.

What's more is that it comes with a built-in stand that easily swings in and out -- no folding required -- and while I originally thought this would be useless, I rather enjoyed being able to prop my phone up whenever. Perhaps the best thing about this Belkin pack is that it comes in a few fun colors, a nice feature many competitors still haven't matched.

Like the previous iteration, this pack is still not the slimmest design I've ever seen. But the newly upgraded design offers a more comfortable and sleek user experience that feels great in the hand and doesn't feel as boxy as the pack really is. Overall, I'm impressed with the new shape and think it was a much-needed facelift. 

Apple is the only retailer that sells the blue, green, pink, and sand color options right now (as well as black), which is a bit of a downside. On the flip side, Belkin only carries the black and white iterations as well as the 8k and 10k models. Regardless, Redditors who own this battery pack really like the intentional upgrades. [Some Redditors said](https://www.reddit.com/r/MagSafe/comments/1bszq57/belkin%5Fboostcharge%5Fpro%5Fqi2%5Fpower%5Fbank%5Fa%5Fnice/) that this is a great pack to replace Apple's discontinued battery pack, too.

## Baseus 10,000mAh magnetic portable charger

### Best large capacity MagSafe battery pack

Not all wireless battery power packs are created equally. Take this Baseus 10,000mAh magnetic power bank, for example. Most battery power packs can only supplement a little battery boost, but not this one. With this power bank, you can get up to two recharges on an iPhone and charge two different devices simultaneously. 

This power bank is for iPhones with MagSafe, but Android users can also reap the benefits of this bank with a couple of added accessories. When ZDNET contributor Adrian Kingsley-Hughes tried out the battery pack, he said the magnetic connection was "one of the best I've seen" and said the power bank is "more than enough" to get you through a day of hard work. 

**Review:** [**Baseus 10,000mAh magnetic portable charger**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-the-cable-this-magsafe-battery-pack-is-good-for-up-to-two-full-recharges/)

How much juice you can get from the power bank depends on your iPhone. If you have an iPhone 13, you can recharge it about 1.8 times with Baseus's charging capacity and 2.1 times with an iPhone 12\. For around $46, it's also a pretty affordable bank for the battery it replenishes. 

Amazon reviewers also noted that they liked the quality, appearance, and charging performance of the Baseus power bank. Many said they appreciated the dual charging feature and the strong magnetic attachment to their iPhone. 

_Author's Note: At the time of publication, customers can save 20% at Baseus with promo code_ **_MAG20_** _at checkout._ 

**Baseus 10,000mAh magnetic portable charger** **specs** **: Capacity:** 10,000mAh/18.5Wh | **Charging Port:** Wireless Charging (7.5W and 15W) + USB-C (20W PD) | **Power button:** Yes

### Best MagSafe battery pack with a stand

If you're someone who does a lot of work with your phone, having a battery pack that you can use both on the go and at your desk is incredibly important. When former ZDNET associate editor Christina Darby tested out this Anker 622 magnetic battery pack, it provided her and her iPhone-dependent workflow with everything she needed in a single package.

**Review:** [**This Anker MagSafe charger offers something Apple's doesn't**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-59-anker-magsafe-charger-offers-something-apples-doesnt/)

With a single magnetic click, this battery pack can be stored in your pocket or propped up using its sturdy magnet to create a stand. Additionally, you don't have to worry about charging your phone and your battery pack separately, as you can charge both simultaneously when the pack is connected to a power source. Darby noted that the battery pack is lightweight and well-priced at under $60 compared to Apple's offerings.

Verified Amazon customers noted that they liked the performance, size, and quality of Anker's 622 power bank, highlighting the kickstand's functionality and the pack's easy portability. However, some also noted that it warms up quickly and overheats. 

_Author's Note: At the time of publication, Anker is offering their 622 MagSafe battery pack for 15% off with an on-site promo code of_ **WSCPV2KSFPP4**.

Pros 
* Ergonomic, compact design
* No overhang off of phone
* Competitive power capacity
* Easy to use
* Great designs, colors, and prints
* Strong magnetic grip
* Multiple charging uses

Cons 
* Gets a bit toastier while charging than some competitors
* On the more expensive end

## Casely Power Pod

### Best MagSafe battery pack for style and function

If you're looking for the ultimate combo of style and function -- the Casely Power Pod battery pack is for you. This battery pack uses MagSafe technology to snap onto the back of your iPhone or other device. It will also attach to and charge through any [case that is MagSafe compatible](https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-reasons-you-should-be-using-a-magsafe-case/) or any case that is wireless charging compatible, and Casely even includes an adhesive magnetic ring that attaches to any non-MagSafe case or device, which will turn it into a MagSafe-compatible accessory. 

It offers 5,000 mAh of battery capacity and a max wireless output of 15W that can be used three ways: as a MagSafe battery pack, as a Qi charging pad for things like wireless earbuds, or as a traditional battery pack with a USB-C cord. When I tested the Power Pod last month, I couldn't get enough of it. After starting with a fully charged Power Pod, my iPhone 14 Pro went from 47% to 83% after an hour of MagSafe charging, and I still had 50% charge left in the Power Pod. The magnetic grip is plenty strong, too, and the on/off button on the front of the pack makes it super easy to find and use. 

**Review:** [**Casely Power Pod**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/finally-a-magsafe-battery-pack-that-doesnt-look-like-a-brick-and-it-charges-fast-too/)

But the Power Pod's crown jewel isn't any of the above features. Instead, unlike its brick-esque competitors, the Power Pod features a clean, curved, ergonomic design available in 50 different colors, patterns, and prints. It also has a smaller overall footprint compared to other MagSafe battery packs I've tested, making it easy to toss into a going-out purse or small bag. After all, why should your battery pack have to look boring? 

Current Power Pod reviewers on Casely's website like the endless designs and seamless compatibility (both physically and aesthetically) with their phone cases and the easy, reliable power boost the pack offers. This battery pack certainly isn't going to give your phone the biggest power boost out of the options on this list, but you'll definitely get the most compliments and the best aesthetic appeal. 

_Author's Note: At the time of publication, Casely is offering a BOGO on their power pods with the code_ **_BOGO-WEEKEND_** _at checkout_

**Casely Power Pod MagSafe battery specs** **: Capacity:** 5,000mAh | **Charging Port:** USB-C | **Power button:** Yes

* Compact and travel-friendly design
* Evenly distributes charge
* Fast charge rate
* Foldable

Cons 
* Pricey
* Not for those only looking for a MagSafe battery pack

## Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station

### Best 3-1 MagSafe battery pack

If you're in the market for a compact, wireless, and travel-friendly charging setup (or just something to curb those cords at home) -- this is it. Revealed at CES 2024, this charging station has a compact form factor, one comparable to a deck of cards, while still being able to charge multiple devices simultaneously with impressive speed. 

**Also:** [**I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-found-a-qi2-charging-station-that-can-do-it-all-and-apple-users-will-love-it/)

The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station leverages Qi2 technology to snap onto the back of your iPhone and delivers 15W fast charging. In addition, it has a a retractable arm to set your Apple Watch and a pad for your AirPods or any earbuds compatible with wireless charging. 

When ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz tested it earlier this year, it boosted her iPhone 14 from 40% to 60% in just 30 minutes -- while she remained using it. Ortiz also found that the charger steadily charged her multiple devices relatively evenly when 3-1 charging was used. 

Verified customers like the foldability and charging capabilities of the Anker MagGo 3-1\. They mention that it's portable, and performs well. However, some users experienced a weak magnetic connection or thought it was too expensive for what it provided. And if you don't need a multi-charger, or don't own an Apple Watch, though, you can probably skip out on this one. 

_Author's Note: Anker is discounting this foldable charger to $88 (save $22) with on-page coupon code WSPEV2ZAHF0S through Sept. 1_

**Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station features**: 3-1 charging | 15W fast charging | Compact (folds to the size of a baseball) | USB-C connectivity

Pros 
* USB-C port

Cons

* Does not sit flush against phone depending on the case

## HyperJuice Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack

### Best alternative MagSafe battery pack

Hyper's Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack packs a punch. With a total capacity of 5,000mAh, it's also the chunkiest pack out of the group, despite most of the packs I reviewed having a similar capacity. On the front of the pack are indicator lights and a power button, which I find to be the perfect placement for easy charging. 

A USB-C cable charges the pack up, which supports pass-through charging and can double as an external battery pack to charge via a wired connection. When I tested the Hyper pack last month, it charged my iPhone 14 Pro from 48% to 76% in an hour, and I still had 25% of juice remaining in the pack as backup. If bulkiness isn't a factor for you, the Hyper pack is a solid option to get the job done. 

My only complaint with this pack is that it does not sit flush against my phone due to a bumper design around my camera lens on several of my phone cases. This makes the Hyper battery move around more than I would like, weakens its magnetic grip, and makes it more susceptible to falling off or being knocked off. Overall, I'd still recommend the HyperJuice battery pack because of its practical design and fast charging.

Customers said they enjoyed the Hyper battery's practical charging rate and reliable power boost. Still, they noted it's a snug fit on some iPhone models, depending on your phone case, and that it's just a tad bulky. Still, one reviewer called this pack "nearly perfect" on Hyper's website reviews.

## Which MagSafe battery pack is right for you?

There are a few factors worth considering when you look at this group of MagSafe-compatible batteries. The first, and arguably most important, is how much you want to spend. From there, you need to take into account the various brand options, the physical size of the battery pack, how you plan to use it, and how often. 

| **Choose this MagSafe battery pack...**          | **If you want...**                                                                                                                 |

## Factors to consider when choosing a MagSafe battery pack:

If you're looking to purchase a MagSafe battery pack, there a few things to keep in mind.

* **Charging** **efficiency:** Most power bank companies claim that your phone should last more than a day with 5,000 mAh. Therefore, battery packs within the 5,000-20,000 mAh range are likely best for most people's needs.
* **Pass-through charging capabilities:** Chances are it's not only your phone that could benefit from some battery but a whole device ecosystem. Pass-through charging allows other connected devices to charge simultaneously.
* **Portability:** A battery pack won't do you any good if you can't take it on the go. Consider options that are sleek, compact, and don't weigh you down.
* **Use**: It will be easier to select a MagSafe battery that works for your lifestyle if you spend some time thinking about where you'll be using it and when. On the train to work? While you're walking out and about? Just at home? Just in case of an emergency? Asking yourself these types of questions may help you narrow down what factors, such as size, charging capabilities, and charging rate, are most important to you.
* **Price:** Phones are expensive enough, so your battery pack doesn't need a hefty price tag to match. Consider budget-friendly options with a quality charge and features, and decide how much you're willing to spend to juice up your phone on the go.

## How did we test these MagSafe battery packs?

ZDNET went hands-on with all of the MagSafe battery packs on this list. We spend time affixing these packs to our own iPhones during our daily activities and lives to test out recharge rate, magnetic strength, pass-through capabilities, comfort, and more -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you "add-in" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? 

If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. 

Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that's why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and your budget and why our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted.

## What is a MagSafe battery pack?

The MagSafe Battery Pack allows for on-the-go, wireless charging that is easy and reliable since it attaches to the back of your iPhone.

## Is MagSafe charging better for your battery?

MagSafe charging is great for when you need your phone to charge while you are out and about, making it a better option for some. Just be careful to pay attention to your phone's temperature, as the MagSafe pack can make your phone warm, which is not good for your device. 

## Why should you get a MagSafe battery pack?

A removable battery pack makes it easy to charge when you need it and ditch the battery when you don't. If you find yourself constantly looking for an outlet while carrying a wall adapter and cable, then a battery pack would be a good fit. 

## Why did Apple discontinue its MagSafe battery pack?

Apple's own MagSafe battery pack was discontinued following the release of the latest iPhone 15 lineup in 2023\. Though Apple frequently updates its products, the discontinuation doesn't come as a surprise considering the iPhone 15 models all feature USB-C connectivity while the original MagSafe battery pack was equipped with Apple's lightning capabilities.

## Why bother with MagSafe?

MagSafe capabilities can enhance your user experience and your iPhone's functionality. Besides creating simpler, more efficient wireless charging, MagSafe technology opens the door for various accessories such as wallets, car vent clips and mounts, fitness mounts, power banks, grips and key ring accessories, and more to widen the iPhone experience and make your life as efficient as possible.

## Should I get a power bank or a MagSafe battery pack?

The answer to this question ultimately depends on your needs. Let's walk through it. A power bank can technically have MagSafe capabilities, and some MagSafe battery packs offer dual-charging, but not all offerings are the same. 

Traditionally, a power bank refers to products without MagSafe capabilities, ones that rely on a lightning or USB-C cord to charge your iPhone, and that cannot be affixed to your phone with magnetic grip. These are great options for road trips, emergency charging situations such as power outages, or to store as a "just-in-case" item in your car, work bag, or home. 

On the other hand, MagSafe battery packs offer charging via magnetic grip. Most of these battery packs can be attached to your phone, making them perfect for air travel, commuting, and everyday activities. They also do not require a cord for charging, though some MagSafe battery packs can be used like a battery pack with a cord. 

What's a better buy for you will depend on where and when you want to juice up your iPhone, so I recommend taking a look at our "Factors to consider" FAQ and really thinking about how your backup battery needs to function in your day-to-day life to be worth your money.

## Will a MagSafe battery pack fit the iPhone 15?

If you've recently bought a MagSafe battery pack for your iPhone, you shouldn't have any issues with fit or compatibility when you decide to upgrade to the new iPhone 15\. However, if you have a first-generation MagSafe accessory, it may not fit perfectly due to design changes since the technology was first introduced. 

## Other MagSafe battery packs we've tested:

Although we've gone hands-on with the products on our list, there are tons of other options available on the market. Here are a few alternatives that we've tested which offer compact size, extra features, and strong magnetic grips.
