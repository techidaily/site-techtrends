## IPhone Users Guide to Preventing Unwanted Calls From Private Numbers
### What to Know

* Silence unknown callers:**Settings** \>**Phone** \>**Silence Unknown Callers** \> move slider to on/green.
* Screen calls:**Settings** \>**Focus** \>**Do Not Disturb** \> move slider to on/green >**People** \>**Calls From** \>**All Contacts** .

 This article explains three ways to block unwanted calls on the iPhone.

## How Do You Block No Caller ID Calls on an iPhone?

 There are lots of ways to block no caller ID calls on the iPhone. The phone includes some features specifically designed to block these calls and it also gives you some tools you can adapt to this use. You can also get help from your phone company and the national Do Not Call registry.

## Silence Unknown Callers on iPhone

 The simplest way to block unknown callers on iPhone is to use a built-in feature by following these steps:

1. In the**Settings** app, tap**Phone** .
2. Tap**Silence Unknown Callers** .
3. Move the**Silence Unknown Callers** slider to on/green. With that done, all calls from numbers not in your address book are automatically silenced and sent to voicemail.

 Most phone companies provide paid services that[block scam calls](https://www.lifewire.com/block-scam-calls-on-iphone-5203199) and telemarketing calls. The iPhone's features should be enough for most people, but if they're not for you, or you want another layer of call screening, contact your phone company. Expect to pay an extra few dollars per month for this service.

## Block Calls on iPhone With Do Not Disturb

 The iPhone's[Do Not Disturb](https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-iphone-apple-watch-2000547) feature lets you block all kinds of notifications—calls, texts, app alerts, etc.—in certain conditions and time periods. The feature is designed to let you focus on work, driving, or sleep, but it can also be used to screen unwanted calls. Here's how:

1. In the**Settings** app, tap**Focus** .
2. Tap**Do Not Disturb** .
3. Move**Do Not Disturb** slider to on/green.  
![Focus settings path to Do Not Disturb](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A878RVRtoJxDb4s7EBOf38RZcII=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B1-Block-No-Caller-ID-Calls-2e1354d0dbd14494ba49d4a8e5f4b9aa.jpg)
4. In the**Allowed Notifications** section, tap**People** .
5. In the**Also Allow** section, tap**Calls From** .  
 You may also see this sequence as:**Allow Notifications** \>**People** \>**Allow Calls From** .
6. Tap**All Contacts** or**Contacts Only** . With this done, you'll get calls from anyone in your iPhone address book app, but all other calls from any number not in your address book will be silenced and sent directly to voicemail.

10. With the No Caller ID contact now added to the blocked contacts list, any caller who has no caller ID info—which is a hallmark of spammers—will be sent right to voicemail.

 You can also get help in blocking unknown callers from the U.S. government (if you live in the United States, that is). Add your number to the national[Do Not Call Registry](https://www.donotcall.gov) .

 FAQ

* What does "No Caller ID" mean?  
 A caller who shows as "No Caller ID" is hiding their number. They do this to make their calls harder to block or track, especially if they're involved in scams.
* How do I find out who called if they have no caller ID?  
 Because the caller is masking their identity by hiding their number, it's hard to find out exactly who it is. It doesn't really matter, however, because almost every time you see a call like this, the person calling is up to no good. It's best and easiest to take the above steps to block them, or don't answer when you see "No Caller ID."
