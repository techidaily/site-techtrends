Pros 
* Adjustable stand
* Bumper and rugged shell
* Magnetic mounting capability
* Front cover
* Stylus holder
* Wireless charging for Apple Pencil
* Great color options
* Under $100

Cons 
* No fun patterns or prints

## Zugu iPad Pro Case

### Best iPad Pro case overall

Let me start by saying the Zugu iPad case is truly a solid case, and I really like it. It features an adjustable stand with 8 configurations, a bumper and rugged shell for added drop protection, a stylus pocket, wireless charging capabilities, and more. Plus, Zugu has cases available for preorder for the new M4 iPad Pro models. 

I tested this Zugu case on my iPad Air (pictured above) for the past few weeks along with several other cases, it's my favorite. It's extremely functional but still practical, providing true security from bumps and drops (not just operating as a light cover). I loved using it as a stand, especially while testing several note-taking apps this month. The material feels premium and expensive with a clean, appealing design. 

And while the functionality is top-notch, my favorite thing about the Zugu case is the color. I've been using the case in the Desert Rose color, and as a true Gen-Z corporate girl, I love it. Many companies don't cater to colors outside of black, white, tan, and brown, so the unique color choices are awesome, but I still wish there were more fun prints and designs. The new iPad Pro model cases also have limited colors for now, but I expect to see more soon.

Current customers on the Zugu website said they like the overall protection, functionality, quality, and aesthetic of the Zugu case. Many said the case is a great value and has a premium feel, and one customer even said they wished they'd found Zugu sooner. 

What's even better is that Zugu will pay a [one-time AppleCare+ repair fee](https://www.zugucase.com/pages/free-ipad-repairs) if your iPad is damaged while in a Zugu case. The Zugu case is well worth the money in my opinion, and it's a solid all-around case for style and protection.

**Zugu iPad Pro Case features:** Adjustable stand with 8 angles | Bumper and rugged shell for drop protection | Air flow vents | Secure magnetic mount capability | Microfiber interior | Auto sleep/wake magnetic cover | Stylus pocket on back | Wireless Apple Pencil charging compatibility | Free AppleCare+ Repair Fee

Pros 
* Fun designs and patterns
* Folio style
* Apple Pencil storage/charging
* Doubles as stand
* Under $100
* Shock absorption
* Raised bezel design

Cons 
* Stand configurations could be more comfortable
* Folio front feels a bit flimsy
* No cases for new 13-inch iPad Pro

## Burga iPad Pro Case

### Best basic iPad Pro case for style

Burga's folio case for the iPad Pro combines style and function. It features a spot for stylus storage and Apple Pencil charging, has a hard shell backing and a soft close folio front, can be used as stand for your iPad, features shock absorption and a raised bezel design, and is overall sleek in profile. 

When I tested the Burga case on the iPad Air the last few weeks (pictured above) I liked its light weight, handy Apple Pencil storage, folio style cover, stand configuration, and numerous prints and designs. It's a great basic case to protect from everyday bumps and scratches, but I recommend bumping up to something more secure such as an Otterbox or even the Zugu case if you're accident prone or are more rough around the edges when it comes to your tech. 

I also wish the stand options on the case were a bit more comfortable for viewing, though it's a nice add to have the option to prop up my iPad up at all while watching a show or video. For the $60 price tag though, I think this a great buy for the features you are getting, especially considering a similar folio case from Apple is now around $80 and ones at Casetify start at $92\. 

Current customers on the Burga website said they like the overall value of the case, with emphasis on the case's design, build, and and quality. Many said they enjoyed the fun patterns and color options -- which outdo most other case mentioned on this list in the color department, and compete with the likes of only Casetify. 

**Burga iPad Pro Case features:** Raised bezel design for camera and screen protection | Apple Pencil storage and charging spot | Variety of colors and styles | Shock absorbing bumper | Stand configurations | Never-fading prints

### Best iPad Pro keyboard case

The Logitech Combo Touch is our pick for the best overall iPad Pro keyboard case thanks to its top features and affordable price. The Combo touch is packed full of function thanks to a detachable keyboard, backlit keys, built-in stylus storage, iPad OS shortcut keys, and more. It offers four modes of use (type, view, sketch, and read) to suit iany of your iPad activities. 

**Review: [My favorite iPad keyboard and stylus are not made by Apple](https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/)**

When ZDNET's Senior Reviews Editor Kerry Wan tested the Combo Touch and Logitech Crayon Stylus with the iPad 10th Gen back in 2022, he lauded its ability to "flex on the Magic Keyboard \[Folio\]." 

"Logitech's Combo Touch cover and Crayon stylus for the iPad are cheaper and practically better than Apple's own accessories. \[They\] are not perfect, but they deliver a more feature-rich experience than Apple's first-party accessories at a fraction of the cost. That's not a knock on Apple's own iPad keyboard and stylus by any means; the two are just as worthy of your consideration," Wan wrote in [his review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/logitech-combo-touch-crayon-review/). 

Current customers on the Logitech website said they liked the top of the line features, overall value, and price point of the Combo Touch case, which has over 100 5/5 star reviews. One customer, like Wan, even said it beat out Apple's own Magic Keyboard. "This product is exactly what I hoped Apple was going to provide. And, it was at a fraction of the price," they wrote. 

**Logitech Combo Touch** **features**: 4 modes (type, view, sketch, read) | Detachable keyboard | Backlit keys | Stylus storage | Full row of iPad OS shortcut keys | 1-year limited warranty | Two viewing angles

## OtterBox Defender

### Best iPad Pro case for max durability

Some people use their iPads to scroll on the couch, but others need a tablet in the field. Whether you work in construction, utilities, or another boots-on-the-ground industry, you might want your iPad Pro to be able to venture out with you. Enter: the OtterBox Defender Series Pro Case. 

With raised edges, it offers drop protection for your screen and camera. Plus, the Defender Series Pro case comes with OtterBox's silver-based antimicrobial additive, which means your case actively fights bacteria growth. Finally, the case offers port covers to ensure any dirt and dust you encounter in the field doesn't clog up your jacks and ports. Cases for the new iPad Pro 11-inch and 13-inch models are currently available for preorder.

**Review:** [**The OtterBox Defender Series case for iPad Pro**](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/otterbox-defender-and-symmetry-for-apple-ipad-pro-10-5-3-layer-rugged-and-stylish-protective-cases/)

Current users on Best Buy said they like the value, quality, and overall ease of use, giving the Defender case 4.5/5 stars on the site. Many users said they like the secure durability and protection from bumps and scrapes, but some users said they had issues getting their Apple Pencil to stay secure.

## Moft Snap Float Folio Case

### Best iPad Pro case for versatile angles

The Moft Snap Float Folio case is one of the most unique iPad cases I've tested in the last few months, which doesn't come as a surprise. Moft makes some of the most innovate, origami-inspired mobile and tech accessories I've seen. 

The Moft Snap Float Folio case features a strong magnetic connection with a sleek and slim design that makes the case feel elevated and premium. The stylus holder is a plus, and the case configures into three different angled positions. One standing position is an ultra high alignment (as pictured) which lifts your iPad up above much of the competitors. 

The case is a duo system, so you can customize which parts you want to use at any given time. There's a soft outside folio and a hard case set for extra protection. They can be used individually or together, and it's easy to change. I tested the Moft case for the last month on my iPad Air, and I especially liked the standing configuration, which allowed it to be eye-level. It's perfect for working from home or personal video calls. I also enjoyed the premium look and feel, which is certainly more elevated than some other case options on this list. One downside right now is there is no iPad Pro 13-inch case available.

Current Moft Float Folio users said they like the overall design and quality feel of the case, as well as the functionality thanks to the unique stand configurations. One customer even said Moft cases deserved more hype than they get. "It's the best case and holder ever. The quality of materials is great, the finishes are great. You can put it in any position you're thinking of and your iPad is very well protected too. Simply the best. This product should be better known," the customer wrote.

**Moft Snap Float Folio Case** **features**: Stylus holder | Three unique stand configurations (one ultra high) | Premium construction and feel | Slim profile | Duo case set | Affordable luxury style

## Factors to consider when choosing an iPad Pro case

If you're in the market for an iPad Pro case, here's a few factors to keep in mind: 

* **Size:** It is critical that your iPad case and cover be compatible with your iPad Pro. Check the size of the case to ensure that it will fit your iPad model, so it won't be too small or too large.
* **Build:** iPad cases and covers can be made out of many different materials. The best iPad Pro cases and covers incorporate durable materials like rubber and polycarbonate plastic. Some are even rated for drop protection, providing an extra level of durability and security for your device.
* **Features**: Not all cases are created equal, and they don't all offer the same features. Consider if you will want or need a trackpad or keyboard, stylus holder, adjustable stand, or other features to help narrow down your search and make it easier to find your top contenders. You don't want to purchase a case that doesn't fit your wants and needs.
* **Design:** Why not add a little style to your iPad Pro? Many of the best iPad Pro cases and covers are available in a variety of different colors and patterns so you can add a splash of personality to your everyday carry, if that's what you're looking for.
* **Budget:** There are many affordable iPad Pro cases available, but there are also some that cost well over $100, depending on the design and features. Setting a budget for yourself can will help narrow your search parameters.

## Does my iPad Pro need a case?

If you put a case on your smartphone, why wouldn't you put a case on your iPad Pro? Cases and covers help ensure the device you spent money on is protected through travel and everyday bumps and bangs.

Investing in a good iPad Pro case is investing in your iPad Pro. Adding a case can only improve your tablet's lifespan. 

## What are the new iPad models?

Apple announced the 6th-generation iPad Air and the 7th-generation iPad Pro models on May 7, 2024\. You can preorder the tablets now on Apple's website, and they are officially available on May 17.

**Also: [How to preoder the new iPad Air, iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-apple-pencil-pro-and-magic-keyboard/)**

The new iPad Air comes in two sizes for the first time (11 inches and 13 inches) and features the M2 chip. In addition, the iPad Air now starts at 128GB instead of the mere 64GB that Apple previous included in the base model. The iPad Pro is available in an 11-inch or 13-inch display. 

## What are the iPad Pro sizes?

The 4th and 5th Gen iPad Air models have a 10.9-inch display, and the 2022 iPad Pro models have either an 11-inch or 12.9-inch display (iPad Pro 11-inch 4th Gen or iPad Pro 12.9-inch 6th Gen). The newest iPad Pros will feature either an 11-inch or 13-inch display. 

You can compare sizes and see [display and model information](https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-air-3rd-gen,ipad-air-5th-gen,ipad-10th-gen) on the Apple website.

## Are the iPad Pro 2022 the same size as the iPad Pro 2024?

Yes and no. The 2022 iPad Pro is available in either an 11-inch or 12.9-inch display. Apple's newly announced Pro models are either an 11-inch or 13-inch display, which means that it's likely many existing 11-inch cases may work for the new model, but the 12.9-inch iPad Pro cases won't perfectly work with the new 13-inch iPad Pro. 

We suggest selecting a case that is specifically designed for your iPad's display size, and we anticipate more case options for the new iPad models to hit the market soon.

## Do I need an iPad Pro keyboard case?

The answer here boils down to how you want to use your iPad Pro. If you frequently use your iPad like a mini computer setup to do work, school, or other typing and stylus-driven activities, a keyboard case could be a great option for you -- especially if you want to optimize your iPad and upgrade how you can use it. 

If you just use your iPad Pro for entertainment like catching up on your favorite TV show, an expensive keyboard case is probably not worth your investment.
