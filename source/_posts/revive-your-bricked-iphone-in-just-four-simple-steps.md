### 1\. Force Restart Your iPhone

A force restart is the simplest way to fix bricked iPhone without restoring. It won't erase any data on the device.

Most of the time, a restart or reboot can fix small bugs on your iPhone. Get help if you want to know how to [force restart your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208078). 

### 2\. Charge Your iPhone

Your iPhone will be stuck in a black screen when it has no power. Plug in your iPhone and let it charge for half an hour. Learn what to do if your [iPhone won't charge or charge slowly](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

### 4\. Reset iPhone to Factory Settings

Before you restore your iPhone to factory settings, make sure you are using the latest version of iTunes. You [have a backup of iPhone data](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). A restore will wipe all the information off iPhone. You can use MacX MediaTrans to make a backup for your iPhone easily, including videos, movies, music, ringtone, iTunes purchases, photos, ebooks, etc. 

Step 1: Open iTunes on your computer, connect your iPhone to your computer using the iDevice USB cable.

Step 2: Select your iPhone name on the left side of the iTunes window. Click the Summary tab.

Step 3: Click Restore iPhone and confirm to restore. The device should restart after the process completes. You can also do a DFU mode restore, which is said to work for some users.

Hardware damage may lead to a bricked iPhone. If all the above methods don't work as expected, contact Apple Support or go to an Apple Store, or make a Genius Bar reservation for more help if necessary.
