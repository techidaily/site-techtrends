## How to Fix Mfc71.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download the mfc71.dll DLL file individually from any "DLL download site."

If you need a copy of this file, it's always best to obtain it from its legitimate, original source.
