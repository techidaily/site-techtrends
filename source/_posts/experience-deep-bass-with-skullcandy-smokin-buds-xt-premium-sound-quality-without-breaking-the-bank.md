## Experience Deep Bass with Skullcandy Smokin' Buds XT – Premium Sound Quality Without Breaking the Bank

### Key Takeaways

* The Skullcandy Smokin' Buds XT are a great option for wireless earbuds under $50, offering solid sound quality and impressive bass.
* The earbuds have excellent passive noise isolation, making them ideal for use in noisy environments or during workouts.
* While the case feels cheap and the call quality is subpar, the overall value and performance of the Smokin' Buds XT make them worth considering.

 I think Skullcandy is one of the best budget-friendly audio brands, and if you’ve been on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless buds, you should consider the [Skullcandy Smokin’ Buds XT](https://www.skullcandy.com/smokin-buds-wireless-earbuds/?maas=maas%5Fadg%5Fapi%5F8445262540301%5Fmacro%5F1%5Fmaas&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&aa%5Fcampaignid=20272180547&aa%5Fadgroupid=&aa%5Fcreativeid=ad-%5F%5Fdev-c%5Fext-&gad%5Fsource=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0%5Fmh%5F0epGfWu5DfjtpOSMb62ZfMBQj1RAjQ16OMqSIrmxh2LmSgz4eMaAtrPEALw%5FwcB). They fit great, sound awesome, and have some of the best passive noise isolation you’ll find for the price.

##  Design: Solid Fit, Cheap Case

 The Smokin’ Buds XT have a sleek appearance and come in two color options, True Black and Matcha. The box contents include the buds and charging case, a USB-C to USB-A charging cable, small and large-sized ear tips (the buds are already equipped with the medium size), and a user manual.

 I liked that both the buds and charging case have LED status indicators, but that’s where my compliments for the case end. Yes, it’s just a cheap plastic case, but Skullcandy doesn’t do much to distract from that, and it’s a bit on the bulky side. At least the smaller case of the [Skullcandy Dime 3 True Wireless Earbuds](https://www.skullcandy.com/dime-3-wireless-earbuds) is smaller and includes a built-in lanyard hook.

 Fit-wise, things started improving though. I had no issue getting the Buds XT to fit my ears and was able to use the ear tips that were already equipped. Jumping and jostling did nothing to unseat them either, and the fact that these are IPX4 buds makes them ideal for sports and exercise.

 Like the Skullcandy Dime 3 True Wireless Earbuds, the Smokin’ Buds XT have touch controls mapped to the top of both earbud stems. Unlike the Dime 3 though, the Buds XT taps and long-presses won’t send the earbuds deeper into your ear canals. This is because the Buds XT stems don’t have a clicking mechanism. Instead, you just tap or long-press the upper stem’s flat surface.

 Commands include play, pause, call answering, and call hang-ups with a single tap, volume up with two taps, volume down with three taps, and EQ preset cycling with four taps. You can also press and hold to call up your phone or tablet’s voice assistant. There are also a few manual pairing and re-pairing commands you can execute by pressing and holding for longer than three seconds.

##  Sound Quality: Awesome for What It Is

![A person holding the Skullcandy Smokin' Buds earbud](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/person-holding-a-skullcandy-smokin-buds-earbudjpg_53055597230_o-1.jpg)

 Considering the super-low price, I actually thought the Smokin’ Buds XT sounded really good. Over the course of several days, I put them through a number of audio tests, encompassing multiple music genres and podcasts.

 In terms of music, I’ve been on a bit of a Tool kick lately, so I did a full run-through of the “10,000 Days” album with the Buds XT. Bass player Justin Chancellor tends to hang out in the lower mid-range, favoring hard picking over finger-style strums. The end result is a percussive low-end that sounds brilliant on tracks like “[Vicarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h%5FTUP2vuaDs)” and “[The Pot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=civuoU%5FNE38).” The Buds XT had no issue handling Chancellor’s play style, on top of providing a solid soundstage for the rest of the band.

 Note that I didn’t say “wide soundstage,” because that’s not the case here. Metal, pop, and acoustic tracks all sound fairly compressed, but to be honest, I didn’t really mind. For less than $50, I think Skullcandy did a nice job at honing in on the most important parts of a sound mix (especially if you’re really into bass).

 As a frequent “WTF with Marc Maron” listener, I played through several interviews using the Buds XT, and they all sounded pretty good. There’s even a dedicated podcast-listening mode, which highlights the upper mids and pulls out a lot of the low end. I did prefer doing most of my listening in Standard mode though, which adds a little extra punch to the audio.

##  Call Quality: Not Awesome

 I recently reviewed the Skullcandy Dime 3 True Wireless Earbuds, and I thought the call quality was abysmal. Somehow, the Smokin’ Buds XT are worse. During a test call with my girlfriend, there was a horrible hiss whenever she would talk. And according to her, I sounded just as terrible on the other end of the call.

 I don’t have much more to say here, other than a firm suggestion to not use these for phone calls. You can hear for yourself.

##  Battery: Matches the Skullcandy Promise

 Skullcandy claims the Smokin’ Buds XT should last for up to eight hours on a full charge, with 12 additional listening hours provided with a fully charged case.

 I can stand behind these numbers, and can also vouch for the XT’s quick-charge capabilities. At one point during testing, both buds died, but I was able to charge them up in 10 minutes or less.

##  Should You Buy the Skullcandy Smokin’ Buds XT?

 I’m a big fan of Skullcandy products, especially for its [budget-friendly](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/exploring-the-eus-artificinas-regulation-and-its-effects-on-gpt-like-interactive-assistants/) wireless earbud lineup. That being said, I would give the [Skullcandy Smokin’ Buds XT](https://www.skullcandy.com/smokin-buds-wireless-earbuds/?maas=maas%5Fadg%5Fapi%5F8445262540301%5Fmacro%5F1%5Fmaas&ref%5F=aa%5Fmaas&aa%5Fcampaignid=20272180547&aa%5Fadgroupid=&aa%5Fcreativeid=ad-%5F%5Fdev-c%5Fext-&gad%5Fsource=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0%5Fmh%5F0epGfWu5DfjtpOSMb62ZfMBQj1RAjQ16OMqSIrmxh2LmSgz4eMaAtrPEALw%5FwcB) a solid single thumbs-up ([headphone fans](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/perfezionamento-dei-numeri-italiani-per-la-comunicazione-da-1-1000/) may want to look elsewhere).

 If you’re really into genres like rap and metal, you’re going to love the type of bass these buds are capable of. I’m a huge fan of the passive noise isolation these are able to achieve, and appreciate how much battery life each bud (and the charging case) is able to hang onto.
