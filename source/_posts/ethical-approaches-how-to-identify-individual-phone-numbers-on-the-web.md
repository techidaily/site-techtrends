## Ethical Approaches: How to Identify Individual Phone Numbers on the Web
 It used to be that if you needed to find a phone number, you picked up the phone book for your area and thumbed through the listings until you found what you needed. These days, those phone books exist in a much smaller format, and in most places include only landline phone numbers or even only business phone numbers.

 There are plenty of reasons you might need to find someone's phone number. Maybe you've lost an old friend's contact information, you're getting calls from a number you don't recognize, or you wrote down a number but forgot to provide context.

 From general search engines to more obscure (and focused) websites like Zabasearch, the websites on this list will help you find a phone number for free.

![Phone number search on Google](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NwSoNEVjvVh_TJ2MOYbg0xv3PZY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/google-phone-number-search-14ca2a0b2f894e998c1e553ad2ead92a.png)

 A simple search with a generalized search engine like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo may even be able to track down a name, address, email address, and recent personal updates, all in the same place.

 To find someone's phone number on Google, for example, you may need to do some digging by entering their name and the area they live in. But to do a[reverse number lookup](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-find-a-cell-phone-number-online-3482156) , all you need to do is enter the entire phone number (area code included) into the search field, and see what comes back.

 In most cases, the number will be identified within the first five search results. Select one of these results, and you'll see business information, addresses, relevant contacts, and more.

## Try Toll-Free Phone Numbers

![800 number for Apple Google search](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cML7cbxH6rTCtwzimTUOOLIPz1g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/apple-800-number-ca05419d0a0245d8b6045d3f29edd8f3.png)

 Toll-free phone numbers are free to call and can be your instant gateway into a company's inner workings.

 There are quite a few toll-free number directories on the web that give extensive 1-800 number listings; however, you can also use your favorite search engine to track down nearly any toll-free phone number.

 There are a couple of different ways you can accomplish this:

* **800 number for company** : Simple yet effective. Type**800 number for company** , substituting the name of the business you're looking for the word "company," and sometimes you'll get lucky.
* **Contact us** : This is often a very successful method of finding contact information. Type**"contact us"** (yes, in quotes) plus the name of the company (e.g.,**"contact us" microsoft** ).

 Niche search engines focus on something other than regular web page searches, such as finding only people-related information.

 These sites can be useful resources for when you're looking for a phone number because they look at only information that could be tied to individuals, such as a number, an address, social networking updates, and business contact resources.

 Since every search engine returns different information from the next, it's definitely worth a try to type your person's name or phone number into various search tools, such as a[people search engine](https://www.lifewire.com/search-engines-that-top-the-web-3482269) , to see what comes back.
