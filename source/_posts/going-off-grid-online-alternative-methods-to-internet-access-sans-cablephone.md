## Going Off-Grid Online: Alternative Methods to Internet Access Sans Cable/Phone

Close 

###  What to Know

* Use an[ ISP search tool](https://broadbandnow.com/) to look up a provider in your area.
* Compare plans, contact multiple providers, and ask around online.
* You probably don't need the provider's highest speed option, but do think about data allowance.

 This article explains how to get on the internet at home when you[ cancel cable](https://www.lifewire.com/cut-cord-cancel-cable-tv-4122484) .

##  How to Find Internet Service Without Cable or a Phone Line 

  
 Many households have found creative ways to save on their monthly overhead by avoiding major cable companies or phone service providers when it comes to getting internet service. As technology improves, there are more and more ways to sign up for high-speed internet service without having to pay for cable or a home phone.

 To get started, you need to find out which companies offer internet in your area. This will often include one or two big names like Xfinity, Cox, or AT&T, along with smaller local providers or DSL service resellers.

 Shopping around and talking to numerous[ ISPs](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) can work in your favor even when few choices are available, as many internet providers offer introductory deals and/or rebates for switching to their service.

 So, how do you know which internet companies are near you? There's a service for that. Here's how to use it:

1. [ Visit BroadbandNow's internet provider search tool](https://broadbandnow.com/) and enter your ZIP code into the box.

2. Review the prices, speeds, and other details that are important to you.

3. Check with your current provider to see how their offerings compare.

 When you contact the provider, ask about installation and equipment fees, too; no one wants to find extra charges on their first month’s bill. Above all, like any monthly subscription service, take your time to carefully compare your options.

##  Questions to Consider Before Getting Internet 

 Some big-name[ telecom companies have made headlines for overcharging customers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/charter-and-twc-overbill-customers-by-7-2-million-per-year-senate-finds/) for basic services and equipment, or even misleading them by [ hiding sneaky loopholes](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/comcast-facing-100-million-lawsuit-service-plan/) in their contract's fine print to charge for services they claim are free.

 Before you jump into a contract, there are some questions you should consider when choosing the right cable-free internet service provider for you:

* Is there a data cap? What happens if you exceed your monthly allowance?
* What are the download speed options? Do these change with my data usage?
* How reliable is the connection? (Don't ask the company; read user reviews.)
* If[ satellite internet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-space-based-internet-4584920) is an option, is your physical location conducive to good reception?
* What contract lengths are available? Is there a fee for terminating service early?
* Are there additional costs? For example, will the quoted price increase after an introductory period?

##  How Fast Does My Internet Need to Be? 

 In addition to cost, which just depends on your budget, the deciding factor when choosing to get internet with no cable is[ network speed](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-network-speed-818118) . That’s not to say that faster is always better. Many households don’t really need a high-speed connection for their daily needs.

 If you plan to stream audio or video or play games online, however, you’ll need a fairly high-speed connection. On the other hand, if you're someone who mainly browses the web and answers the occasional email, a much lower-speed connection is fine. If a higher speed isn’t available in your area and you still want to stream video, don’t be disheartened;[ speeds as low as 5 Mbps are sufficient to stream most video content](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-requirements-for-movie-viewing-1847401) .

 Since faster connections are often more expensive, consider your needs wisely before choosing an internet plan. Note, too, that[ advertised speeds don’t always match the actual speeds you’ll get at home](https://www.lifewire.com/is-your-internet-speed-as-good-as-promised-4007146) . Ask a potential ISP if it will allow you to conduct an in-home test before signing up.

 If you're not sure how fast your internet should be,[ run a speed test with your current setup](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-test-your-internet-speed-2617987) . Use that number to gauge what you should order from your new ISP. Most companies make it easy to increase the speed later if the initial plan you pick ends up being too slow.

##  Should I Buy My Own Router? 

 Specialized equipment like[ modems](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-modem-817861) ,[ routers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-router-2618162) , and optical network terminals (for[ fiber](https://www.lifewire.com/fiber-optic-cable-817874) ) are necessary for internet service. An internet provider will supply you with the right hardware for your particular service when you sign up, but they might charge you a monthly fee to use it, which can easily add up after just a few years.

 The alternative is to[ use your own network hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/required-to-build-wireless-networks-816542) . Buying your own router, for example, can cost significantly less in the long run and give you the freedom to keep the item should you ever switch ISPs.

 While you might be tempted to price-shop for a router, investing in the newest, fastest tech can ensure the best speeds, compatibility, and security in the long run.

 Before buying, consult with your ISP to determine what exactly you need and what they recommend. Don’t be pressured into renting one from your ISP if you don’t have to.

##  Finding Internet Service in a Rural Area 

 Unfortunately, millions of U.S. households still do not have many choices when it comes to broadband access, particularly in rural areas. Less than 70 percent have access to broadband internet and[ over two million have no internet at all](https://www.changelabsolutions.org/blog/broadband-connection-rural-communities) . For various reasons, installing the required infrastructure for broadband internet is still difficult in these areas.

 Companies like[ HughesNet](https://www.hughesnet.com/) and[ Viasat](https://www.viasat.com/) have sprung up to fill this gap by providing satellite internet to rural areas.[ Starlink also delivers internet via satellite](https://www.lifewire.com/is-starlink-worth-it-8572453) and could be exactly what you need. Their website lets you search for your address to see if it's covered,[ and there's an availability map](https://www.starlink.com/map) .

 If those options don't work for you,[ try the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/) . It has several grant programs designed to bring broadband access to rural areas. These require a lengthy application process and have limited annual budgets but can be the perfect solution in certain parts of the country.

##  What If I Need a Home Phone? 

 Don’t let the need for a home phone keep you from cutting the cable and switching to an internet-only plan. Thanks to[ VoIP technology](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-difference-between-voip-and-ip-telephony-3426732) , it’s possible to[ connect a phone to the internet](https://www.lifewire.com/phones-you-can-use-with-voip-3426327) and use it like a landline phone. There are dozens of VoIP providers on the market.

 Another option is to avoid the home phone completely. Many people opt to use their smartphones for all their calling needs. If you like the idea of using the internet to make calls or you don't get great mobile service at home,[ there's an app for that](https://www.lifewire.com/free-internet-phone-calls-1356646) .
