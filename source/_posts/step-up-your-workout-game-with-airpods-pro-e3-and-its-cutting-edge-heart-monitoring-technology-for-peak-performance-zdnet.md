It has only been a few days since [Apple's Glowtime event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/)[,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/#link={) and we're already getting insight into what the tech giant has in store for the future. [9To5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/09/apple-testing-health-sensors-earbuds/#link={) dove into the files of the latest iOS 18 beta and found lines of code hinting at a heart-rate sensor coming to future earbuds.

A string within the software mentions how wearing both earbuds during a workout would allow users to "track and send your heart rate to Apple Health." This feature would then be managed within the pair's Bluetooth settings. The code doesn't mention which devices will house the sensor. However, sources close to 9to5Mac claimed it'll be available on AirPods Pro 3 and the "next-generation of Powerbeats Pro."

A heart-rate sensor appearing on the latter may come as a surprise, but if you think about it, it makes sense. Apple teased the Powerbeats Pro via a [social media post](https://x.com/beatsbydre/status/1831346598636626377) on September 4, with MLB star Shohei Ohtani wearing the pair, suggesting that the earbuds will possess some sort of athletic functionality, such as tracking a person's heart rate.

The function won't be forced on users, as 9To5Mac reports that people will have the option to disable it for privacy reasons.

It's important to mention that there have been several rumors over the past year or so about what kind of changes the AirPods Pro 3 will introduce. [Back in October 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/apple-airpods-plans-4th-generation-low-end-3rd-generation-pro-and-usb-c-max), Bloomberg's Mark Gurman noted how the series is set to receive a design update and new chipset in 2025.

The name of the hardware is unknown at this time, although online reports have referred to it as the H3\. According to Gurman, that chip will reportedly power multiple health features, such as a biometric monitor and temperature tracking alongside the aforementioned heart rate sensor.

Other rumors claim the AirPods Pro 3 will also double as a hearing aid, a functionality coming to the [AirPods Pro 2](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cf8cbff80-ca76-4e75-9438-3f58add7dc74%7Cdtp&dtb=1) soon. If you're interested in picking up the future earbuds, you will likely have to wait a while. Rumors state the AirPods Pro 3 won't launch until fall 2025\.
