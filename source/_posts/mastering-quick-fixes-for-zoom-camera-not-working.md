## Boosting PS5 Performance for Ultra-Smooth Visuals at 120 Frames Per Second
### What to Know

* Go to**Settings** \>**Screen and Video** \>**Video Output** and enable 120 Hz output. You'll also have to turn it on in-game.
* Make sure you have a compatible 120 Hz display.
* Only certain games support 120 frames per second on PS5.

 This article explains how to get 120 frames per second—which you'll also see as "FPS" or "Hz"–on PS5\. Not every game on PS5 supports this option, so while you can prep your console for it, it won't work for every title.

## How to Turn On 120 FPS on PS5

 Most games that support 120 FPS also have other graphical modes that run at different frame rates, like 30 FPS and 60 FPS. You'll want to check your in-game settings for a 120 FPS toggle or a "Performance Mode" that you can turn on.

 Depending on the game, the exact setting you'll need to adjust and where it's located will change, but you can usually find what you're looking for in a "Video" or "Graphics" section in Settings or Options.

1. Turn on your PS5, and open**Settings** from the main menu.

2. Then, navigate to**Screen and Video** .

3. Choose**Video Output** on the left side of the screen.

4. Select**120 Hz Output** .

5. Select**Automatic** (you won't have an**On** option because not every game supports 120 Hz output).

6. Now, if a game has an option for 120 frames per second and you turn it on, your PS5 will output at that rate.

## What You Need to Get 120 FPS on PS5

 The most important requirement is a display with a 120 Hz refresh rate. You can use a TV or a monitor, and displays with 120 Hz support are pretty common today, so you shouldn't have trouble finding one.

 If you're not sure if the display you've got has a 120 Hz refresh rate, the easiest way to check is to search up your model of display and consult its specs page. You may also find it in the info window on the back of your monitor or TV.

 You'll also need an HDMI 2.1 cable. You can use the HDMI cable that comes with the PS5, which is a 2.1\. However, if you're using a different cord (because the included one wasn't long enough, for example), you'll need to make sure it's that type.

 Lastly, keep in mind that not every game supports 120 FPS. You won't typically see that information on the game box, unfortunately, but you should find it in shop listings. And, of course, you can check the menus for a 120 FPS option.
