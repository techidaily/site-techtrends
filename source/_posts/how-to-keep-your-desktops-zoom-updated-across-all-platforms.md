## Access iCloud Photos From iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad

 ​Photos is an excellent app for viewing images or making video memories. It's also a directory from which you can share photos in an email, text message, or on social media. Use the Photos app to send images to a nearby Apple device using[AirDrop](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-airdrop-how-does-it-work-1994512) or save images to other cloud-based services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

 Tap the**Share** icon >**Save to Files** to save the image to any service you set up in Files, such as iCloud Drive or Google Drive, or on your device.

 Before using iCloud Photos on your iOS or iPadOS device, you must turn on the iCloud Photo Library: Select**Settings** \>**Apple ID** \>**iCloud** \>**Photos** . Then, complete the following steps to access your photos:  

1. On your iOS device, tap**Photos** .
2. Select**Library** .
3. In the options bar, tap**Years** ,**Months** , or**Days** to view images by that period, or select**All Photos** .

## Access iCloud Photos on Mac

 As with iOS and iPadOS, the Photos application in macOS is the quickest way to view photos in iCloud Photos. The images are in collections, and you can[watch the Memories created from the images and videos](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-create-photo-memories-on-the-ipad-4089908) there.

 You can drag images from the Photos app to any folder on your Mac. You can also drop photos into other applications, such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages.
