### July 2024 Unpacked Event

 The following products were announced at the July 2024 Unpacked event.

* [Galaxy Ring](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-ring-8431146)
* [Galaxy Watch 7 and Watch Ultra](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-8607182)
* Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro
* [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-8621840)
* [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.lifewire.com/galaxy-z-fold-6-8418354)

 The Galaxy Ring is a brand-new device for Samsung. They mean you to wear it all day, and it focuses particularly on sleep tracking. It has three sensors: an accelerometer, a photo-based cell to read heart rate, and one that measures your skin temperature.

 The big change for the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the programmable Fast Button, which you can use to quickly start a workout or do other tasks. Both watches include gesture controls that let you do things like turn off phone alarms or take pictures with a double-tap of your fingers.

 The Galaxy Buds come in two types. The main difference is that the regular Galaxy Buds 3 are an open type (the buds sit against your ear canal), while the Buds 3 are canal-type (the buds fit inside your ear canal). Both versions have dynamic equalization and noise-canceling, along with 24-bit audio, but only the Buds 3 Pro have a two-way speaker.

 The foldable devices–the Flip 6 and Fold 6–continue the company's dedication to artificial intelligence with new photo editing and generation features. One notable one has your phone generating a fully rendered image based on your sketch.
