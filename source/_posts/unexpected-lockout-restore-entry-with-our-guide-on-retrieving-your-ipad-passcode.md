##  How to Recover a Forgotten iPad Passcode 

 No long-term trick exists to get past the passcode you need to unlock your iPad. You can use Touch ID or[ Face ID](https://www.lifewire.com/face-id-4151714) to bypass it for a time, but after the iPad reboots, you'll have to enter the passcode.

 The only way to fix the problem of a forgotten passcode is to[ reset the iPad to factory default settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-your-ipad-1994506) . This means erasing everything on the iPad. However, during the setup process, you can[ restore your iPad from a backup](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-icloud-how-to-backup-restore-1994517) .

 The easiest way to deal with a forgotten passcode is to use iCloud to reset your iPad. Use the Find My iPad feature to reset your iPad remotely.

1. Open a web browser and go to [ www.icloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) .
2. Sign in to**iCloud** when prompted.  
 If you have[ two-factor authentication set up](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-two-factor-authentication-on-iphone-4799065) on your account, a code is sent to all your Apple devices. You'll need this code to continue signing in to iCloud.  
![Sign in to iCloud.com webpage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rQCB4v66ByBMSi6NQJ3cNeu1j0E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_fix-forgot-ipads-password-1994344-5bdb427046e0fb00264e05f1.jpg)
3. Select**Find My** .  
![Find My icon on iCloud.com webpage](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/buOO__xxAzELu_gAdqgvio6QyII=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/015-how-to-fix-my-ipad-password-or-passcode-a2dd53c4c3cf49dd81f5a41d93d6f648.jpg)
4. You will be prompted to enter your login credentials to use Find My.  
![Login prompt to use Find Devices.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TThpXrn1n38duDBHIMrd0nfLMFE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/016-how-to-fix-my-ipad-password-or-passcode-a48e1f2ccdc84a3487d8d582b771ecdd.jpg)
5. When the map appears, under**All Devices** , select your iPad from the list.  
 Your iPad will be named whatever you named it. Not simply iPad.  
![All devices in the Find Devices menu with the iPad highlighted.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfZpYeb1lVcUXvSjpYMiFN1TanU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/017-how-to-fix-my-ipad-password-or-passcode-65410c83ee8e4afbbe484fece0a6da74.jpg)
6. When you select the name of your iPad, a window appears in the corner of the map. This window has several options:**Play Sound** ,**Mark As Lost** (which locks the iPad down),**Notify When Found** ,**Erase iPad** , and**Remove This Device** .  
 Verify that the**device name** above these buttons is your iPad. This way, your iPhone won't be erased by mistake.
