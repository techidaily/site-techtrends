## Deciding Between Building or Purchasing Your Own Computer - Find Out the Best Option
 It's easy enough to pick out a new computer to buy. The other option is to gather[all the necessary components](https://www.lifewire.com/desktop-pc-parts-checklist-832694) and build the PC yourself. We looked at the pros and cons of both to help you decide whether to build a computer or buy one off the shelf.

## Overall Findings

 Buying a PC

* Support is easier to obtain.
* No problems with hardware compatibility.
* Better warranties and accidental damage coverage.
* Advanced skills aren't required.

 Building a PC

* Customize for your needs.
* Nearly limitless choices for hardware.

 All computer systems sold on the market are a collection of components that provide a functional computing system. Processors, memory, and drives are some of the[parts that make up a computer](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) and differentiate one system from another. As such, the performance and quality of a system are determined by the parts used in its construction.

 So what is the difference between a store-bought system and a custom-built computer from parts? There could be almost no difference to a very significant difference based on the parts selected for the machine.

 When purchasing a new PC, consider your skill level and budget. There are pros and cons to both decisions.

## Buying a PC: Pros and Cons

### Advantages of Buying

 For some, building a PC may be too complicated. One of the major benefits of buying a pre-made system is compatibility. The manufacturer ensures that the physical parts and the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) work together to minimize performance issues.

 Another important advantage of buying a PC is the warranty and support for the system. You typically have options for an advanced warranty, with some manufacturers covering accidental damage. This also means you have a single point of contact for warranty or support issues.

 One more significant consideration when choosing to get a pre-built PC is that you don't have to research individual components to ensure compatibility, quality, and other factors. The manufacturer often provides different configuration options to offer a flexible selection depending on your needs. Plus, you don't have to be a technology guru to configure a new PC. If you're unsure of the offerings, there's usually a phone number or email to ask questions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Disadvantages of Buying

 The major disadvantage of buying a pre-made PC is the cost. Generally, a computer that's ready to go right off the shelf costs more than the homemade variety because manufacturers tend to use non-OEM parts. Retail computer parts can be higher in price, driving the end cost of a pre-made PC up as well. An exception to this rule is when there are sales on pre-built PCs. Many companies have exclusive sales during the holidays, such as Black Friday, or clearance sales to make room for new models. But, overall, it will cost you more to buy a ready-made computer.

 If you like to know your computer intimately, purchasing a pre-built PC might not be the way to go. Since the manufacturer decides the components, you probably won't do a ton of research to know each part in the system. With this, there will be less customization. So, if you want in-depth knowledge of your computer and need to fine-tune it to your needs, a pre-made system probably won't serve you well.

## Building a PC: Pros and Cons

 Advantages

* Customize components for your needs.
* Have deeper knowledge of the parts in the PC.
* Can be cheaper than a pre-built computer.
* Customize for greater performance.

 Disadvantages

* No single point of contact for support.
* Requires considerable research.
* Novice users may struggle with the technical side of the build process.

### Advantages of Building

 The most obvious advantage of building a computer from scratch is the selection of parts. Most computer systems come pre-built with the specifications and components selected for you. This often leads to consumers making compromises on features because a mass-produced system may not have all that you want or may offer a subpar component. By building your own computer, you can choose the parts that best match your desired setup. Some vendors do allow you to customize a computer system, but you are limited to their selection of parts.

 Another thing to be aware of with pre-built systems is that two of the same model computer can have different parts. The reason for this is the suppliers, parts available at the time the system was built, and luck. For example, Dell might switch between multiple suppliers of memory because one is less expensive than the other. Similarly, they may swap hard drive brands if one has supply problems. Buying the parts yourself guarantees what ends up in your computer.

 One of the less tangible advantages of building a computer from scratch is knowledge. You'll learn and understand how the parts work together. This is valuable when troubleshooting computer problems. Knowing what components control the different sub-systems of a computer means you can repair hardware problems without dealing with support groups or expensive repair bills.

 Finally, there is the cost. The more powerful your intended desktop computer, the more likely you can save money by building your own. This is because many premium components carry high markups by the manufacturers as a means to boost profits. While many of the small companies that build high-end systems may build a PC from the exact parts that you want, they mark up the price to cover the costs of building it and supplier support after the purchase.

### Disadvantages of Building

 One of the biggest disadvantages of building a computer is the lack of a single support organization. Since each component likely comes from a different manufacturer, if a part has a problem, you'll deal with the appropriate company. With pre-built systems, you only have to contact the manufacturer and their warranty service. This can also be an advantage in terms of building it yourself as a part failure is often quickly and easily resolved by replacing the part yourself rather than waiting for a large company to send out a technician or ship the system back to them.

 Additionally, and this is a big one, choosing the parts to build a computer system can be a frustrating process. This is particularly true if you aren't familiar with the technology and are building your first computer. You have to consider sizes, compatible components, wattages, and more technical stuff. If you don't research things properly, you could end up with parts that don't work well together or, at the very basic level, don't even fit in the[computer case](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-computer-case-2618149) you selected.

 While cost is an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage. This is particularly true if you want to build a basic desktop computer. Manufacturers get discounts because they buy parts in bulk. And the budget market is competitive, which means it's often cheaper to buy a basic computer for web browsing and productivity software than it is to build one. The cost savings may not be huge, maybe $50 to $100\. Conversely, you can save hundreds over buying a PC if you look at a high-performance desktop PC. Low-cost pre-built systems can also leave much to be desired in the quality department.

## Final Verdict: Know Your Needs and Skills

 If you don't need a computer for a specialized task or high-end computing, a pre-made system may be the way to go, especially if you're not technically minded. Building a PC requires technical know-how and patience.

## How to Build a Computer

 If you're interested in building a desktop computer from parts, take the next steps.

 Several companies sell base systems that are referred to as â[white box notebooks](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-white-box-laptop-chassis-832338) . These have the base components such as chassis, screen, and motherboard installed. You can then select items like memory, drives, processors, and graphics to finalize the laptop. These basic laptop chassis are often sold to PC companies to then badge as their own after finishing off the component installations.

 If you are determined to build a PC from parts, research the parts. There's a range of components available including[PC sound cards](https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-sound-cards-833111) and[Blu-ray drives](https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-blu-ray-drives-832423) . It's impossible for PC hardware and review sites to look at every one of these, but we can get you started:
