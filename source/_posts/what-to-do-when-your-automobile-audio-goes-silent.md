4. Plug your MacBook into power.
5. Connect your MacBook to an external monitor using an adapter if necessary.
6. You can now close your MacBook without the external display turning off. Note that the display on the MacBook itself does turn off, just not the external monitor.

 If you want to use your MacBook in this configuration permanently, you can use the Mac sleep scheduler to have it sleep and night and wake up in the morning automatically.

## Why Does My MacBook Sleep When I Close the Lid?

 Your MacBook sleeps when you close the lid for several reasons, depending on whether it's plugged in. When plugged in, it sleeps to help conserve energy and allow it to charge more quickly, as it uses much less power while asleep. When running on battery power, it sleeps when you close the lid to conserve battery power. Since you typically don't need to use your MacBook when the lid is closed, the default setting is for the display to turn off and the MacBook to sleep whenever the lid is closed.

 The most common reason to want to keep a MacBook from sleeping when the lid is closed is if you're going to use it with an external monitor and keyboard. Apple makes that reasonably easy if you follow the instructions provided in the previous section.

## Can You Keep a MacBook From Sleeping With the Lid Closed Without a Monitor?
