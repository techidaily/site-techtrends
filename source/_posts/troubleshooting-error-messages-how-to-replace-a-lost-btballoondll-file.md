## Trouble with Missing 'Rockaldll.dll'? Here’s How to Correctly Fix the Issue
 Most rockalldll.dll files are associated with Rockall Heap Manager, which is used by some computer games.  

 The rockalldll.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Rockalldll.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download rockalldll.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore rockalldll.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" rockalldll.dll[file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-file-2625878) is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the rockalldll.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the rockalldll.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the rockalldll.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. If reinstalling the game didn't fix the error, open the software's installation folder and look for a folder called**DirectX** . Double-click**DXSETUP** to run it. This should replace the missing DLL file that's causing the error.  
[How to Download and Install DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489)
4. If you're experiencing this error when using the[Wars of Liberty](http://aoe3wol.com/) mod for_Age of Empires III_ , that website lets you[download rockalldll.dll directly from their website](http://aoe3wol.com/files/rockalldll.dll) (if left-clicking doesn't open that link properly, right-click it to find the save option).  
 Put it wherever the error messages says it's missing, likely the same folder where the game's executable is located (such as the_Age of Empires III_ directory).  
 Wars of Liberty must be installed in the correct AOE3 installation folder. So, even if you download rockalldll.dll and put it where it needs to be, if the WoL mod itself isn't installed correctly, you might see an error like "RockallDll.dll...file missing."
5. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some rockalldll.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the rockalldll.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
6. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the rockalldll.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration, a[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
7. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to rockalldll.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file rockalldll.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The rockalldll.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
8. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if rockalldll.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The rockalldll.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause rockalldll.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair rockalldll.dll related issues in the registry. A registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid rockalldll.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. We've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the rockalldll.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step, so make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any rockalldll.dll errors persist. After a clean Windows installation, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
