## Understanding & Overseeing Your Internet Data Spending: Key Insights & Tools
### What to Know

* Open your phone's**Settings** app to**Cellular** (iPhone) or**Connections** \>**Data usage** (Android).
* Some carriers let you dial a number to see data usage:**\*3282#** (AT&T),**#3282** (Verizon), or**#932#** (T-Mobile).
* Alternatively, log in to your online account in a web browser or through the company's app.

 This article explains how to check data usage directly from an iPhone or Android phone or through a major carrier, such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and more.

## How to See How Much Data You Have Left From Your Phone

 Both iPhone and Android let you check how much data has been used on your cellular plan. If you know how much is allotted to you monthly, then some simple math will tell you how much data is left.

### Check iPhone Data Usage

 iPhones store this information in**Settings** \>**Cellular** . Scroll down to**Cellular Data** . The figure next to**Current Period** is the running total.

 Checking data on your phone is fine, but it only reveals the data usage for_your_ phone. If you're part of a family or multi-line plan, you'll need to contact your provider for deeper insights (see below).

### Check Android Phone Data Use

 How this works on Android differs between operating systems and manufacturers. If searching the**Settings** app for**data** or**usage** doesn't get you there, try these directions to[check data usage on your Android](https://www.lifewire.com/track-data-usage-on-your-android-121660) :

* **Settings** \>**Connections** \>**Data usage**
* **Settings** \>**Network & internet** \>**SIMs** \>**Verizon** (or your carrier)

## Check Data Usage With Xfinity

 For mobile users, see the iPhone and Android information above. Each phone line is limited to a certain amount of data per line.

 If you are an Xfinity subscriber for cable and home internet, there are two ways to check your data usage: the web and the app.

[Visit the Devices page of your Xfinity account](https://customer.xfinity.com/#/devices#usage) to find the**Data Usage Overview** area. In the Xfinity app, tap**Account** at the bottom and then**Data Usage** to see how much you've used in the past few months. If you have an xFi Gateway, open the app to**WiFi** \>**View WiFi equipment** \>**Advanced settings** \>**Data Usage** .

## Check Data Usage With AT&T

 The easiest way to check AT&T data usage if you subscribe to their phone service is by dialing**\*3282#** (it's**\*DATA#** if that's easier to remember). For Spanish, dial**\*3286#** .

 AT&T will send you a free text message summarizing your next billing date, total data usage, and what data overage (if any) has occurred. If you’re on a family plan, you’ll even be able to see the usage for each number on your account.

 The myATT app is another option. For example, to check your home internet data usage, open the**Services** tab and then tap**Home internet** . Next to**My data usage** is the current total for the month. This same information is available through the[myAT&T account overview page](https://m.att.com/myatt/native/deepLink.html?action=Overview&appInstall=N) .

![AT&T data usage details for a home internet plan](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7RmYEL_9VqG08UQ4Q9tN651jWcQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/att-home-internet-data-usage-983515821e3746a8b3cc9c079a9d40da.png)

 To avoid surprises at billing time, use the myATT app to set up data alerts and receive text messages when you reach a set threshold. The myATT app’s Video Management feature limits video streams to standard definition at a maximum speed of 2 Mbps.

## Check Data Usage With Verizon

 Verizon provides ways to monitor and control data usage, including a text summary. Dial**#3282** to get a text alert summarizing your data use. Verizon will even repeat the information verbally if you stay on the line.

 The My Verizon app works, too. Go to**Account** \>**Usage** \>**Usage Overview** for those details. This is also where you can set data usage alerts, see which user and which apps use data, and set limits by app or user.

 Depending on which data plan you use, the My Verizon app’s Safety Mode will let you keep using data after you’ve reached your monthly allowance, albeit at reduced speeds. It’s a solid way to keep from incurring overage charges.

## Check Data Usage With T-Mobile

 You’ll receive a text message as you reach 80 percent and 100 percent of your account’s minutes, texts, and data. To check anytime, dial**#932#** .

 T-Mobile’s app does basic data use reporting and manages its Binge On feature. When enabled, Binge On optimizes video as you stream it to limit data usage. So plowing through entire seasons on Netflix doesn’t necessarily mean laying waste to the month’s data allowance.

 To see your T-Mobile data usage from the app, go to**Account** \>**Plans and usage details** \>**Usage** .

![T-Mobile app data usage screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZpqhDemmFT3FN4D3ay3wCDba5H0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-to-check-your-data-usage-4589301-5ff0fede310e48d3aff8a1ecf4f7b432.jpg)

## Check Data Usage With Cricket

 Cricket touts its plans that include unlimited data, so you might not see the need to monitor usage. But there’s a catch. After a set amount of data, Cricket may temporarily slow data speeds when the network is congested. So, keeping track of precisely how much you’ve consumed at the all-you-can-stream data buffet might be worth it if you rely on your phone to stream video.

 One way is to[check your usage through your account](https://www.cricketwireless.com/myaccount.html) by signing in and then going to**Account** \>**Usage** . Pick the phone line you're interested in to see how much data it has used.

 To check your data usage in the[myCricket app](https://www.cricketwireless.com/support/apps-and-services/mycricket-app) , sign in and tap**Usage** at the bottom. Cricket does not automatically send data usage alerts by text.

## Check Data Usage With Boost Mobile

 Most of Boost Mobile’s plans offer unlimited data usage and will alert you to data usage throughout your billing cycle. Like Cricket’s unlimited data feature, however, you have access to a limited amount of high-speed data before you’re throttled back to a slower connection.

 Boost will send notifications as you approach your high-speed data cap. Optionally, you can check usage by[logging in to your Boost Mobile account](https://www.boostmobile.com/) or opening the Boost Mobile app. There, you can track data usage closely, and review outgoing calls and messages.

![Data usage in the Boost Mobile app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JRb4J3vPikJKUO7cQG5aT-EveFw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/boost-mobile-app-data-usage-4b110ad4a30548ff8d48eed2a192458f.png)
