 The layout is clean and easy to use, with attractive icons for recording daily updates about your activities and moods. You can customize the look by choosing different colors and also add text to entries if you'd like to include some written details—though more traditional journaling isn't supported.

 With the free version, you can view your data at a glance, but a paid subscription offers more advanced metrics, and unlimited library of moods, automatic back-ups, and an ad-free experience. These premium features are available on Android only.
