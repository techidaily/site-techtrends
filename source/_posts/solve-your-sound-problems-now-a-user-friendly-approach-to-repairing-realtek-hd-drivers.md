### Bonus tip: How to make the game run smoothly on my computer?

 Many emulator players reported that the game often become stuttering after they play it for a while. This is a very common problem on the PC emulator. Normally, there’re three factors that can trigger this issue: the PC hardware specifications, the in-game video settings and the optimization of the emulator itself.

 For the last factor, there’s nothing we can do to improve the situation, since it requires the developer of the emulator to optimize it. So here we just talk about the first two factors.

 If the specifications of your computer is not so good, you should use the recommended in-game video settings. If the specifications of your PC is good enough, you may need to update your drivers, since the emulator uses heavily on CPU and GPU.

 There’re two methods to update your drivers:**manually** and **automatically** .

#### **Update your drivers manually**

 You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your device. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact device model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

#### **Update your drivers automatically**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
