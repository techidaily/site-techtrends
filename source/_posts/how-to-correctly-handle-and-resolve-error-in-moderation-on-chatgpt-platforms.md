## How to Correctly Handle and Resolve 'Error in Moderation' On ChatGPT Platforms

Close 

 The "Error in Moderation" message can appear at any time when you use ChatGPT. This article looks at the reasons behind ChatGPT's "Error in Moderation" message and offers solutions to fix the issue.

##  What Is the ‘Error in Moderation’ Issue in ChatGPT? 

 "Error in Moderation" typically pops up when ChatGPT's safety filters flag your prompt or the conversation as potentially inappropriate. However, the fault can also lie with the OpenAI servers or any other misconfigurations on the part of OpenAI.

 Broadly, the reasons for the "Error in Moderation" error can be due to these conflicts and more:

* Ambiguous prompts can lead to confusing responses.
* ChatGPT can have difficulty handling discussions about sensitive subjects.
* Struggles with grasping the overall context of conversations.
* Users might intentionally trick the LLM into breaking the rules.
* Challenges with understanding newly popular words or slang.
* Occasional creation of inappropriate content unintentionally.
* Losing track of the conversation topic in extended chats.
* Server outages affecting ChatGPT's broader availability.

 The moderation system is designed to be compliant with[ OpenAI's usage guidelines](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/) . But sometimes, it errs on the side of caution and mistakenly flags harmless content. These false positives can disrupt the flow of conversations with the chatbot and be extremely frustrating.

##  How to Fix the ‘Error in Moderation’ Issue in ChatGPT 

 When you know your prompt is perfectly valid, take the following steps to sidestep the "Error in Moderation" issues.

1. Revise your input prompt. Reword your prompt to remove potentially offensive language, ensuring clarity and conciseness. Use neutral language and break more extended conversations into smaller chunks. Follow best practices for[ writing effective prompts on ChatGPT](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-7197760) to help the bot better understand your intent.
2. Regenerate the response. Select the**Regenerate** icon and see if feeding ChatGPT the same prompt again helps it recover.
3. Refresh or start a new chat. Refreshing the page or beginning a new chat session can sometimes solve temporary glitches behind the moderation error. You can also log out and log in again into ChatGPT.
4. Clear your browser's cache and cookies. Your browser's data can create conflicts with your browsing session. This may not directly impact the moderation error, but it can help fix general connectivity or session issues.
5. Wait and try again. If the issue persists, it may be due to[ server-side problems](https://www.lifewire.com/is-chatgpt-down-8659176) . Check the[ status of OpenAI servers](https://status.openai.com/) . Wait a few minutes and then retry your request, as OpenAI usually resolves such issues quickly.
6. Contact OpenAI Support. If the "Error in Moderation" issue reappears, contact[ OpenAI's support team](https://help.openai.com/en/) for assistance. They can investigate and provide specific guidance.
7. Look at ChatGPT alternatives. If moderation issues continue, consider trying other[ ChatGPT alternatives](https://www.lifewire.com/chatgpt-alternatives-7551608) like Gemini, Perplexity, or Claude, which might have less stringent moderation filters.
