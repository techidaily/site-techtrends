### Best AirTag accessory for Apple TV remote

Nomad's latest leather-bound accessory fixes the need to ever have your Apple TV remote go MIA again. The Leather Cover for Siri Remote & AirTag from Nomad is exactly what its name implies -- a leather case for the remote that also has a spot to hold one of Apple's AirTags. 

The AirTag is hidden in a compartment that's underneath the remote. The inside of the cover is lined with a soft microfiber material that won't scratch the remote or the AirTag. There are cutouts on the three sides of the cover. One in the front, another on the side for the Siri button and one on the bottom to give you access to the Lightning charge port. 

**Also:** [**This accessory lets you add an AirTag to your Apple TV remote**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/this-accessory-lets-you-add-an-airtag-to-your-apple-tv-remote/)

ZDNET's Jason Cipriani tested the Nomad remote cover in 2022, and initially worried the AirTag would be too covered to hear its locator sound being signaled. "However, after a few tests, I can confirm that the AirTag's location sounds are still loud enough to find the remote, whether it's sitting on a counter or underneath the couch," Cipriani wrote.

Current users on Nomad's website said they liked the premium feel, design, and grip the cover provides, as well as the ability to easily locate their Apple TV remote. In fact, 100% of customers on the website said they would recommend the cover to a friend.

Pros 
* Ultra secure
* Wire loop fits around awkward objects
* Unlikely AirTag will fall out

Cons 
* Limited color options

## Belkin Secure Holder with Wire Cable for AirTag

### Best AirTag accessory for security

Likely one of Belkin's most secure AirTag accessories yet, the Secure Holder with Wire Cable for AirTag is designed to attach to luggage, purses, keys, or other belongings with ease. It comes in white or black and features an allen key design to ensure your AirTag won't fall out of the holder, or that the wire will unlock from what it's attached to. 

I am slightly embarrassed to even write this, but the Belkin AirTag holder is so protective, that I initially struggled getting the holder open with the allen key and removing the cable to latch it onto my bag. This is by no means any fault of Belkin, but rather user error and my longstanding issue remembering "righty tighty, lefty loosey." Anyways, this AirTag holder isn't going anywhere once its locked, and your AirTag won't be escaping, either. 

The wide wire loop makes this a great holder for affixing to many things, and it's especially great for those awkward bag handles that are too thick for carabiners or key rings. I probably wouldn't use this style on something like my keys, but If I had to buy only one AirTag accessory off of this list for attaching to a bag, this one would be it. I only wish it came in a few more fun colors like pink, blue, green, purple, or a neon color, which would make them easier to spot if you used them on the outside of luggage like Belkin suggests. 

Current customers on the Belkin site said they liked the overall quality, performance, security, and ease of use of the Secure Holder, generating an average o f4.7/5 stars on the site. However, some users said they also experience some trouble opening the holder, and that the allen key strips the screw, though I haven't personally experienced the latter in my time testing. 

**Belkin Secure Holder with Wire Cable for AirTag features**: Allen key locking system | Braided wire cable | Open design to show engravings | Raised edge to prevent scratches

Pros 
* Keeps keys in order
* Functions as a main keyring
* Easy set-up
* Different material options

Cons 
* Limited color options
* Leather option is pricier

## KeySmart Air

### Best AirTag accessory to organize keys

The KeySmart Air is the "core" of ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes' keychain. This handy tool is both the main key loop and a case for Kingsley-Hughes' AirTag, so he doesn't lose his entire keychain in one swipe.

The KeySmart is available in genuine leather, faux leather, or a flex material. It can store up to 5 keys and it keeps them securely in order, and has a carabiner clip style keyring built in to add your other essentials, like a car fob. 

Customers on the KeySmart website said they liked the easy key organization and leather options the KeySmart Air provides, giving it an overall 4.25/5 stars on the site. Customers also said they liked the easy setup and secure screws.

Pros 
* Durable

* Relatively slim yet multi-functional
* Minimalist design

Cons

## Ridge Wallet

### Best AirTag accessory wallet

The Ridge wallet is a slim RFID blocking wallet designed to handle up to 12 cards. Cash can be stored via a cash strap or money clip on the outside of the wallet, and the brand offers three AirTag configurations for tracking: an AirTag holder designed to  or  for $25, or the [AirTag carbon add on holder](https://ridge.com/products/carbon-case-for-airtag) that attaches outside any Ridge wallet for $40\. 

The Ridge offers durability and functionality, while also providing you with top-notch security and smart capabilities. Although it is a bit pricey, it comes with a lifetime warranty to keep up with your daily use and a risk-free 99-day trial period. And all things considered, a quality, traditional-leather-style wallet could easily run you over the $100 mark too, which makes this long-term investment worth it in my opinion. 

**Also:** [**The best AirTag wallets of 2024: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airtag-wallet/)

The practicality coupled with the RFID technology, numerous color and metal options, and the addable AirTag tracker makes the Ridge nearly-faultless, beyond the fact that it can get a little chunky if it's full to the brim with cards (but alas, what wallet doesn't?). This is a great wallet for small handbags, concert or stadium bags, or going out, too. 

Current Ridge customers said on the website that they liked the wallet capacity, durability, design, and functionality of the Ridge wallet. The wallet features a 4.8/5 starts online, and 97% of customers said they'd recommend the Ridge wallet to a friend. Several customers said they were repeat purchasers, and that their wallets stood the test of time.

**Ridge Wallet features:** RFID blocking | Accessories and add ons available | Several materials and designs | Cash strap or money clip for cash storage

Pros 
* Affordable

Cons 
* Still adds a little bulk
* Not for card only wallets or hard shell wallets
* Requires deep pocket

## Nomad Goods Card for AirTag

### Best AirTag accessory wallet card insert

Nomad's Card for AirTag allows you to pop an AirTag into a thin card-like casing which makes it easy to slide into a traditional wallet, bag, or pocket and transform its tracking capabilities. It is shaped like a credit card with a spot in the center for your AirTag, and it uses Apple's Find My technology to easily link up to your iPhone. 

Nomad says that the AirTag is about as thick as 10 standard credit cards, and claims that the card does not add any additional thickness to your wallet as long as you place the card in a deep pocket to avoid stretching your wallet or bowing your credit cards. 

When I tested this AirTag card on my personal Coach Billfold wallet, I found that claim to be semi-true. It definitely does still add a touch a bulkiness regardless of what pocket it was placed into (as I completely expected it to, an AirTag card is not and won't ever be as thin as a credit card), but I can confirm that it works best in the deep pockets of the wallet instead of the tighter, front pockets. Regardless, for $20, I think this is one of the best ways to upgrade an existing traditional wallet with tracking capabilities. The product itself feels durable and of quality, and I appreciated how seamlessly yet securely the AirTag pops into the Nomad card. 

Current Card for AirTag users on Nomad's website said they liked the overall quality and functionality of the AirTag card, with some even saying it adds a nice structure to their existing wallet. Customers also said they liked how much better of a job the card does at integrating an AirTag into a wallet as opposed to just leaving a loose AirTag in a wallet pocket, despite it adding some slight bulk. 

"The product is great but it's going to add some bulk to your wallet, not the product's fault, but it's the design of the AirTag. Still, this is the easiest way to carry an AirTag. The quality of the product is really good, and it's a convenient tool to have," one customer said in their review. 

**Nomad Goods Card for AirTag features**: Polycarbonate frame provides structure | Soft-touch TPU surface | Easily insert/remove your AirTag with snap-in AirTag mount geometry

## Catalyst Rugged Dog Collar for AirTag

### Best AirTag accessory pet collar

Catalyst's Rugged Dog Collar ($25) is designed to be used in tandem with the waterproof  ($35) to provide a seamless and easy way to track your furry friend. 

Launched at CES 2024, the collar comes with a quick-release press buckle, D-ring metal, and another buckle to adjust the length. The protection case has an open-front patent design for the AirTag to fully project sound and locate your dog. 

**Also:** [**Protect your dog's AirTag with a new collar designed to hold a waterproof case**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/protect-your-dogs-airtag-with-this-new-collar-that-holds-a-waterproof-case/)

The collar is made with durable nylon webbing that's resistant to scratches and tears. It's also designed to resist licking and handle rough-and-tumble play. And for dogs who enjoy swimming or water sports, the collar's material is quick-drying. Plus, the Clip-It AirTag Case is waterproof for up to 330 feet with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating (AirTags are waterproof up to 3.3 feet).

## Case-Mate Tough Sport AirTag Holder

### Best AirTag accessory for daily use

Case-Mate's Tough Sport AirTag holder allows you to secure and protect your AirTag to almost anything. The design features a long, ultra strong strap that's loop-able to secure onto your keys, luggage, purses, and anything else you want to keep track of. When I tested these AirTag holders over the last few months, I found them to be the most versatile style as opposed to ones with keychains or carabiners, which sometimes can't secure on everything. 

The long strap makes it easy to secure on backpack handles, for example, or even the inside key holder of a bag. I also liked that compared to some other picks on this list, these holders are super easy to setup and use, and didn't require any other fussing. They pop in and out quickly and with ease. The colors are a big plus for me too, especially if you're looking for some flare and style, or like me, color coordinate most purchases. 

I personally think this loop design offers some of the most use cases, especially just for tracking everyday essentials, and has a great overall value. 

Current customers on Best Buy said they liked the overall value and easy to use nature of the Case-Mate AirTag holder. One customer even said that it's held up great over repetitive daily use across several months. 

**Case-Mate Tough Sport AirTag Holder features**: Durable outer shell | Long, ultra strong strap | Loopable | Easily insert or remove AirTag | One year limited warranty | Easy to use

Pros 
* Carabiner doubles as bottle opener
* Feels quality
* Durable
* Securely holds AirTag
* Multi-functional

Cons 
* Utilitarian, "tool-like" look
* Limited color options
* A little hard to pop the AirTag in

## Spigen Rugged Armor AirTag Case

### Best rugged AirTag accessory

The rugged build protects your AirTag from bumps and drops, yet it's still lightweight enough to carry around daily. When I tested this AirTag holder, I immediately was impressed with the quality and value -- it feels way more expensive than it is, and I could see it holding up particularly well through years of use. I did struggle a bit to pop the AirTag in and out of this holder however, though after a bit of effort was able to secure it in place, and it stays secure. 

This is a great option for someone looking for a durable AirTag keychain and holder combo, and it would work well on clunkier items like luggage or sports or gym bags, too. My main complaint with this Spigen holder is that it's just too utilitarian and "rugged" for my liking, and offers more of a masculine look, which is of no fault of the product itself, just a personal preference. 

If you're into the rugged look, this keychain is great, and would make an awesome gift or stocking stuffer, too. I wish it came in other colors or a slimmer design that was maybe more dainty in appearance. 

Current customers on Amazon said they liked the quality, ease of use, and fit of this Spigen keychain, with many emphasizing that it feels well-made and durable. However, some customers said they could've gotten away with something cheaper and that it looks too utilitarian for what they wanted. 

**Spigen Rugged Armor AirTag case features**: Lightweight | Modern design | Polycarbonate construction | Rugged build | Carabiner doubles as bottle-opener

## Nomad Leather Keychain for AirTag

### Best leather AirTag accessory

Nomad's Horween leather keychain combines everyday luxury with maximum practicality. Simply slip your AirTag into this little pouch AirTag holder, and that's it. The Nomad keychain feature a thermoformed leather shape that gives a unique look, and it comes with a stainless steel keyring. 

When I tested this AirTag holder, I quickly understood why so many customers liked it. It's an everyday beautiful item that looks and feels sleek and sophisticated, and upgrades the look of your keyring. I liked that it fully covered the AirTag to prevent scratches or damage, and also conceal it. The keychain looks just like a leather accessory, and you wouldn't suspect an AirTag to be inside at all. 

It also was easy to setup, opened and close easily to add and remove the AirTag (yet still kept it secure), and the included keyring isn't one of the cheap, thin ones. It's a thicker, stainless steel ring which helps to elevate the overall look as well. This is a great piece for someone wanting a clean, upgraded look for their keyring, and my only complaints on it are that it -- like other options on this list -- lacks color options or material options. I'd love to see a version of this made with different materials and fun colors, though I do keep in mind that that's not really Nomad's style. 

Current customers on Nomad's website said they liked the overall look and feel of this keychain, with many emphasizing how it patinas nicely. One customer said that it's a perfect blend of subtle and nice. "This pouch styled holder from Nomad is just the right amount of subtle while still feeling nice in the hand and very light on the ring. The leather feels good to the touch and should age nicely - the whole piece is pretty unassuming at first really, but look a little closer and you'll see the thick stitching, the sealed seems, and simple lettering of the nomad pressed in just so. Very nicely done," they wrote in their review. 

However, some customer said that the black leather version's keyring experienced some paint peeling over time.

## Factors to consider when choosing AirTag accessories:

If you're looking to level up your AirTag's function by equipping it with an accessory, here's a few things to keep in mind while you look for the perfect accompaniment. 

* **Purpose**: There are several types of AirTag accessories that you can buy. While the selection is near limitless, concentrate on everyday products that help improve the use or longevity of your AirTag, and not just items that sound cool in theory, but won't actually add value to your routine. It's also a good idea to think about what you're looking to track and how you want to attach your AirTag. If you don't want a carabiner holder for an AirTag you're planning to put in your purse, that's going to factor into your search.
* **Water resistance**: Whether your AirTag will be placed on your pet or your bag, it is important to consider water resistance, so you do not ruin your AirTag by accident. If you need a waterproof case to protect from the elements, be sure to consider this in your search.
* **Type**: Some AirTag accessories come as an individual mount that you can add to a surface, while others may be self-sufficient with their own clip or carabiner. Consider how you plan to carry your AirTag and whether each accessory will improve portability.
* **Price**: The cost of AirTag accessories can run the gamut based on the type of accessory you choose. While a simple mount may be inexpensive, others may incorporate fabrics or other features that can raise the price. Establish how much you're willing to spend on an AirTag accessory to help narrow your search parameters.

## How did we choose these AirTag accessories?

ZDNET has gone hands-on with every AirTag accessory on this list. We've spent time testing these products during our daily activities and lives to rate their function, style, features, and more -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you "add-in" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? 

If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. 

Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. We know buying anything is often not for nothing, and that's why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and your budget -- and why our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. 

## What does an AirTag do?

An AirTag is a type of tracking technology provided by Apple. It uses a Bluetooth signal to find local devices within the Find My Network. You can then use these devices to receive a signal from your AirTag, helping you find whatever it may be affixed to. You can also use your Find My app to locate your device on a map for easier tracking. There are no batteries to charge, and no data usage to track. 

Apple uses top-level security protocols with its AirTag to help protect your privacy. Should it become lost or misplaced, you can put your AirTag into Lost Mode so you can receive a notification on your smartphone when your AirTag becomes detected again. You can also change the settings to allow for notifications to a friend or family member's phone, helping to ensure that even if your AirTag gets lost, it doesn't stay lost. 

## What types of AirTag accessories are there?

The market is flooded with tons of options for your AirTag, and what's right for you will ultimately boil down to what your needs are and what you're looking to track. Here's a few common AirTag accessories to consider as you search: 

* Cases or holders (often affixed with keychains, carabiners, or loops)
* Leather covers
* Mounts
* Luggage and travel tag holders
* Wallets and wallet card inserts
* Pet collar holders
* And more

## What kind of AirTag accessory do you need?

AirTags are a helpful tool because they are small enough to fit any number of places. Before you settle on the best AirTag accessory, first consider where you plan to place your AirTag. It could go on a luggage tag or a pet collar, on a mount or a keychain, bracelet, or lanyard. Once you know what style you prefer, you can begin to narrow your search for the best AirTag accessories for your needs. 

There are also several types of AirTag accessories. Some AirTag accessories use a carabiner to attach itself to other objects, while some opt for a simple holder design. Consider which AirTag accessory best suits your personality, because you certainly have choices. 

## How much do AirTag accessories cost?

AirTag accessories are generally very affordable due to their size and basic design. Most AirTag accessories are under $50, especially keychains, loops, and other simple attachments. However, more bespoke or affordable luxury style accessories can sometimes run you over $50, especially if you're buying multiples. Larger acessories like TV remote trackers or AirTag wallets are pricier, too. 

## What alternative tracking devices are there besides AirTags?

AirTags are not your only option when it comes to bluetooth enabled trackers. Several other products may work just as well for what you're looking for. Some popular alternatives are: 

* Tile trackers (Including the Tile Mate, Tile Slim, and Tile Pro)
* Tracker cards (Such as the KeySmart Smart Card or Chipolo Card Spot)
* Jiobit Smart Tag
* Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2

## How can I find out if an AirTag is tracking me?

If you're an iPhone user, there's a few ways to recognize if an AirTag is tracking you. Your phone may alert you of an "AirTag found moving with you." This will happen if these things are true:

1. The AirTag is separated from its owner.
2. Your iPhone is awake.
