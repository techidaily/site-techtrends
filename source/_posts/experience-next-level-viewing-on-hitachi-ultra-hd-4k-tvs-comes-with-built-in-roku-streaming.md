## Experience Next-Level Viewing on Hitachi Ultra HD 4K TVs Comes With Built-In Roku Streaming
 In addition to its popular streaming stick and media player,[Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) has partnered with several TV makers to incorporate the Roku operating system directly into television sets. This allows Roku to work without need for an external stick or box.

 Haier, Hisense, Hitachi, Insignia, Sharp, and TCL all make Roku-compatible televisions, with many offering either[720p or 1080p](https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378) resolution. Some[4K Ultra HD TV](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) models are also available.

## Hitachi Roku 4K Ultra HD TV Basics

 Roku features are the same on all compatible TV sets. This includes a personalized home screen that provides easy access to internet streaming content and a 4K Spotlight feature that provides quick access to all available 4K streaming content. Other TV functions, such as input selection and picture settings, are accessible via the Roku home screen.

 4K via streaming requires very fast broadband speeds, with[Netflix recommending as much as 25mbps](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830) . If your broadband speed is insufficient for 4K streaming, Netflix and other content providers will "downscale" the signal to 1080p resolution.

 Roku's 5,000+ streaming channels can be accessed via the Roku store. Although there are many free channels (such as YouTube), many require monthly subscriptions or pay-per-view fees. These Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Fandango at Home.

 You can browse through channels or content, or use the search function for a more narrow selection. The Roku Feed option can remind you when a specific show or event is coming, and if there is a fee to watch it.
