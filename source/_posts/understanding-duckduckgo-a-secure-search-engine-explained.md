## [Most-Popular Online Game for Kids: Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/)

![Fortnite Battle Royale online video game.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H1JnE2XNuaZa1D7AM4DlgqDG2Kw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-fortnite-5c026b59c9e77c00013b11da.jpg)

Epic Games

 What We Like

* Completely free to download and play on every major console and mobile device.
* _Fortnite_ supports crossplay which means kids can play with their friends on other systems.

 What We Don't Like

* While free, there is a strong emphasis on buying digital items in-game.
* Game can take several minutes just to load the title screen.

_Fortnite_ is easily one of the most popular video games in the world, for kids and adults.

 While there is a story mode in_Fortnite_ , its Battle Royale mode is what most gamers play. In it, users connect with other players worldwide and, depending on the match's rules, take out the other team or every other player to claim victory.

 The concept sounds violent and inappropriate, but there's zero gore, player deaths are more like digital disintegrations, and everyone gets to dress up in wild outfits such as a teddy bear onesie or a fairy.

 Voice chat in_Fortnite_ is enabled by default to work with other squad/team members, but this can be turned off in the game's settings on all platforms. Kids can still form private chats with their personal friends on Xbox One and[PlayStation 4](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-4-pro-review-4707193) consoles, but this can be turned off entirely by using the respective console's parental restrictions.

 Online purchases can be restricted on gaming consoles by using parental or family settings. Requiring a password or PIN be entered before a digital purchase is processed is also recommended on mobile and consoles.

## [Best Online Game for Creative Kids: Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/)

![Minecraft online gameplay with kids.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wGCrP3SszHGI8vOsLg6aRRk_9DE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-minecraft-5c02672646e0fb0001deb5c6.jpg)

 Mojang / Microsoft

 What We Like

* Equally educational and fun for kids to play.
* The online Minecraft community is fairly kid-safe and student oriented.

 What We Don't Like

* Most versions of Minecraft require an Xbox network account to play, even on the Nintendo Switch and mobile.
* Pre-kinder kids may find the green zombie-like monsters scary.

 Most children interested in video games have likely played_Minecraft_ , seen their friends play it, or watched someone stream it on[Twitch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-twitch-4143337) by now._Minecraft_ is extremely popular with junior gamers and many teachers due to its capacity for instructing problem-solving and construction.

_Minecraft_ has a strong solo-player offline element, but kids can also go online and play with or against other players. Gamers can also share creations and download those made by others. The simplified graphics prevent any action from being too scary, and the voice chat can be turned off via parental settings.

 This game works on several platforms, including desktop and mobile devices, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

 It's recommended to[create an Xbox account](https://www.lifewire.com/create-an-xbox-account-4788308) for your child and manage it yourself.

## [Best Online Kids Game for Star Wars Fans: Star Wars Battlefront II](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2)

![Star Wars Battlefront II online video game on Xbox One and PS4.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/opEHiG6nTMoBCZ8s2g5vECEcPZo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-starwarsbattlefrontii-5c026863c9e77c00015a60aa.jpg)

 EA / Dice

 What We Like

* Kids can still express themselves with humorous emotes when voice chat is disabled.
* The locations and characters look just like they do in the films.

 What We Don't Like

* The action will be too intense for younger players, but no more so than the_Star Wars_ movies themselves.
* Some junior_Star Wars_ fans may dislike the lack of Jar Jar Binks and Porgs.

_Star Wars Battlefront II_ is an action-shooter video game that uses characters and locations from all three eras of_Star Wars_ movies and cartoons. The graphics are simply stunning, especially on an[Xbox One X](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-x-vs-xbox-one-s-4154700) or PlayStation 4 Pro console, and the sound design will make anyone playing feel like they're in the middle of a_Star Wars_ battle.

 There are a variety of fun online modes for kids and adults to play in_Star Wars Battlefront II,_ with the two most popular ones being Galactic Assault and Heroes Versus Villains. The former is a massive online 40-player battle mode that recreates iconic moments from the films, while the latter lets the player play as iconic characters like Luke Skywalker, Rey, Kylo Ren, and Yoda in four-on-four team battles.

_Star Wars Battlefront II_ has no built-in voice chat functionality, though players can still converse with friends using a console's online services, which can be turned off.

## [Best Kids-Friendly Online Shooter: Splatoon 2](https://splatoon.nintendo.com/)

![Splatoon 2 online match on Nintendo Switch.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/roywN4UDMwb_bNBHBSX1O3O_XF4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-splatoon2-5c0269cc46e0fb0001078645.jpg)

 Nintendo

 What We Like

* A third-person shooter designed with kids in mind.
* Colorful characters and levels make it a joy to play and watch.

 What We Don't Like

* Online modes don't feature as many players as other games.
* Only available on the Nintendo Switch.

_Splatoon 2_ is a colorful shooter for junior gamers who are too young for rated-M games such as_Call of Duty_ and_Battlefield_ . In it, players take on the role of Inklings, child-like characters who can transform into colorful squids and back again and compete in online matches with up to eight other people.

 Each match aims to cover the field in your team's color as much as possible by blasting and spraying paint on the floors, walls, and opponents._Splatoon 2_ uses the Nintendo Switch smartphone app for voice chat, which parents can control or turn off.

 While online voice chat features can be turned off in video games and consoles, more gamers are using third-party chat apps like[Discord](https://www.lifewire.com/discord-4174046) to communicate while playing online with friends.

## [Best Online Platformer for Kids: Terraria](https://terraria.org/)

![Terraria online video game.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wNAe3uP4qTOvzHtg5xdMlzUBy3g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-terraria-5c026c4546e0fb000187220a.jpg)

 505 Games

 What We Like

* An action game that encourages creativity.
* Loads of content to keep even hardcore gamers playing for a long time.

 What We Don't Like

* Some menu items are cropped off on some TV sets.
* No crossplay between different versions.

_Terraria_ is kind of a mix between[_Super Mario Bros_](https://www.lifewire.com/super-mario-bros-729677) and_Minecraft_ . Players must navigate 2D levels and fight monsters, much like in a traditional platformer, but they're also given the ability to craft materials they find and create constructs within the world.

 Players can connect with several other gamers to play online, which creates numerous opportunities for some fun, and safe, co-op multiplayer action._Terraria_ relies on consoles' built-in voice chat solutions, which can be turned off by parents.

## [Best Online Sports Game for Kids: Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/)

![Rocket League online video game for kids.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W_-xKL_1ldsvOYT7UxtfA8Q4Mm0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kidsfunonlinegames-rocketleague-5c026d4346e0fb00016f9d1e.jpg)

 What We Like

* Very easy to understand and play due to its soccer-based gameplay.
* It's free, with fun downloadable content based on Hot Wheels, DC Comics characters, and _Fast and Furious_ .

 What We Don't Like

* Strong emphasis on buying in-game digital content with real money.
* Some lag on slower internet connections.

 Combining soccer with racing may seem like an odd choice, but_Rocket League_ pulls it off well and has become incredibly successful with its fresh concept.

 In_Rocket League_ , players drive a variety of vehicles on an open soccer field and must smash the giant ball into the goal just as in a traditional soccer game.

 Gamers can play in online multiplayer_Rocket League_ matches for up to eight people, and there are loads of customization options for kids to personalize their cars and make them their own. Voice chat can be controlled via the console's family settings.

 Konami

 What We Like

* No communications in-game besides the console's built-in voice chat, which can be disabled by parents.
* Fun_Halo_ character cameo in the Xbox One version.

 What We Don't Like

* More online modes would have been nice.
* Graphics look a little old by today's standards.

_Super Bomberman_ is back for modern consoles with more of the classic multiplayer arcade action that made it so popular in the 90s. In_Super Bomberman R_ gamers get to play solo or local multiplayer with up to four other players but the real fun is the online mode where matches consist of eight players.

 In_Super Bomberman R's_ multiplayer modes, the aim is to defeat other players by strategically placing bombs within the maze-like level. Power-ups and abilities provide some variety to the proceedings but overall it's good, simple fun that anyone can play.
