### 2.6 Poor CPU utilization in Handbrake?

Handbrake is a qualified DVD ripper as an open source. It supports you to rip DVDs (unprotected) to MP4 or MKV format with multiple codecs to choose from. If you desire to know its shortcomings, there is one gripe users talk a lot - the poor CPU utilization in Handbrake. The poorer CPU utilization is, the slower ripping speed will be.

To speed up Handbrake in DVD ripping, most users change output profile from "fast" to "very fast" under Presets. But there is no distinct change between ripping speed and CPU utilization. In such case, you're highly recommended to have a shot on MacX DVD Ripper Pro, which sports with the advanced Intel QSV/Nvidia/AMD/M1 (Pro/Max/Ultra) GPU hardware acceleration techs to improve DVD ripping speed up to 150-320FPS, 5X faster than any other competitors. 

### 2.7 Can't rip all episodes?

Different types of DVD disc have their own distinct internal structures. As for TV series DVD, you'd better not treat it as a normal DVD disc. Or you have no idea why your tool can't rip all episodes or all main episodes show up as one title.

 Generally, the TV series DVD is protected by encryption technique and in most cases, only part of TV episodes would be inserted with the encryption algorithm. This can well explain why some episodes can be well ripped while others are missing. In another case, one type of TV series DVD only contains one long title, which needs you to manually cut the long title into several titles with shorter duration. And keep in mind that each episode should start with 0:00 time display. Then begin to [rip episodes from DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

Well, which program can easily remove such DVD encryption and allow you to cut long title to shorter ones? Here MacX DVD Ripper Pro is definitely worth your trial. It can beat off the DVD protection roadblock, as well as cut title into several parts to rip separate episodes from DVD. Since our recommendation is limited, you're warmly welcomed to share with us if you find or have used any wonderful DVD ripping program. 

## Part 3 - DVD Problematic Playback after DVD Ripping

It won't be called a successful DVD ripping if you only accomplish the above two phases. Only when you playback output DVD files without any error can you say it succeed. Unfortunately, roughly half of the users are stuck at the 3rd phase - ripped DVD playback. If you're subject to the DVD output file playback errors, scroll down to find the practical solutions below: 

### 3.1 DVD conversion remains incomplete, only 4MB 

After you backup a full disc to ISO image, you might be surprised to find that the output is only 4MB in size. You rip a DVD to MP4 with a 92-minute main title, but the output file has only 3 minutes. What's wrong? And what would you do? Read the below methods if you have no clue.

**Solutions:**

1). Adjust the cloud decryption setting and pathplay setting if you're using DVDFab. 

2). For handbrake users, upgrade Handbrake to the latest version and try to choose chapter started with Chapter 2, not Chapter 1\. 

3). As for workout DVD, Disney/Sony/Marvel DVD, you'd better utilize a much stronger DVD decrypter to steer away from DVD bad sector DRM protection and choose the correct main title from fake 99 titles for ripping and backing up.

![DVD output is incomplete](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/article-image/output-dvd.jpg)

### 3.2 Audio doesn't match with the scene

**Solutions:**

1). Make sure that your DVD player software has hardware acceleration enabled.

2). Give up backing up some old DVD discs (e.g., DVDs released in 1990s) since they might be in letterbox format and don't correct for the dropped frames.

3). Use VLC media player to solve audio out of sync problem during playback.

4). Buy a professional Digital Audio Delay device if you have enough budget. It's a little bit expensive, around $200 - $300.

5). Re-rip your DVD with a better DVD ripper and adjust output video frame rate to 29.97FPS for NTSC DVD or 25FPS for PAL DVD before ripping disc.

### 3.3 The resulting video is distorted and garbled

Many a user complains at the forums about the distorted resulting video quality. The most likely reason goes to the DVD DRM protection tech CSS (Content Scrambling System). Supposed that your DVD ripper fails to get rid of CSS protection from DVD disc, it stands a high possibility that your DVD output is distorted and garbled. Certainly, if the de-interlacing feature of your application is still in its infancy, the jagged lines are visible on the edges of moving objects.

But no biggie. You can upgrade your VLC media player to work better with Handbrake to rip protected DVDs. If the output quality still doesn't reach your requirements, try cutting-edge DVD decrypter - [**MacX DVD Ripper Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It can work perfectly with any CSS protected DVDs and has the advanced De-interlacing tech to turn any interlaced DVD picture into de-interlaced resulting image, no pixelated or jagged lines thereon.

### 3.4 Ripping DVD's to PC playing as 4:3 not 16:9

It's unbearable that your widescreen DVD 16:9 is converted to 4:3 after DVD ripping using Makemkv or Handbrake. The output video might fill your widescreen TV but it's still distorted. How to fix this DVD conversion error? MacX DVD Ripper Pro can give you a hand.

Instead of wasting much time and energy to figure out the reasons and solutions, a more efficient way is to ditch away the faulty DVD rips and use this DVD ripper to rip your DVD disc with original 16:9 aspect ratio kept. No matter what output format you choose (MP4, MKV, MOV, M4V, AVI), you can get your desired DVD movie file with full screen/widescreen standards for normal playback on your smart phones, tablets, computers and smart TVs.

**Step 4:** Select the audio and subtitle tracks. This Mac DVD ripper enables you to rip DVD with DTS or AC3 audio, alongside with whatever subtitle tracks (forced sub, soft/hard sub or external sub). Move your mouse to the main title area > opt for the audio track you need, AC3 English 6ch, AC3 French 6ch or AC3 Spanish 6ch > choose the subtitle tracks you need. Disable subtitle is the default setting. So don't skip this step.

![select subtitles](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-ripper-pro/article-image/macx-4.png)

Note: supposing that you need to rip DVD with forced subtitle, pick out "Forced Subtitle Only". Or you can load your downloaded or DIY SRT subtitles to your movie if necessary. 

**Step 5:** Tap the settings icon (next to the output format icon) at the DVD video info bar. Afterwards, choose aspect ratio as 16:9 or "keep original". What's plus, one more option is helpful if you plan to [convert PAL DVD to NTSC DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or vice versa. Then you're required to select frame rate as 29.97 fps for NTSC and 25 fps for PAL.

**Step 6:** Click Edit with a scissor-shaped icon at the bottom of the main title. Then you're directed to the DVD video editing window, where you can cut and edit DVD movie to rip certain parts of your DVD movies at your willing. 

\[Optionally\] Tick "De-interlacing" and "Use High Quality Engine" if output quality is your top concern. On top of this, DVD ripping speed also matters a lot. Freely choose the quantity of CPU core utilities you wanna use and see if Hardware encoder (Intel/AMD/Nvidia) is auto ticked. If your computer doesn't support hardware acceleration tech, turn to another one with higher hardware configurations.
