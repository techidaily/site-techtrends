 To turn your iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max back on again, hold the**Side** button down for several seconds and then release it once the Apple logo appears on the screen.

 If you turned off your iPhone 15 Pro to fix some kind of technical issue, wait at least 30 seconds before turning it back on again.

 All iPhone models automatically darken or turn their screens off after a few seconds; you don’t need to manually turn the screen off every time you put your phone down. Go to**Settings** \>**Display & Brightness** \>**Auto-lock** to adjust how long your iPhone stays awake before the screen turns off.
