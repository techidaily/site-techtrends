## Should I Update to iOS 17 or Should I Wait?

 When deciding whether to update to iOS 17, weigh the risks against the benefits. Happily, there are very few risks. The biggest is early releases of new versions of iOS can sometimes be buggy, so it's often wise to wait until a few updates have been released.

 As of this writing, there have been numerous updates to iOS 17; the most current version is iOS 17.5.1\. Given that, you can assume it's pretty stable so don't skip the upgrade just for stability reasons.

### Why Upgrade to iOS 17

 The primary reasons to update to iOS 17:

* **It's free.** It won't cost you anything other than a bit of time to get iOS 17 and all its features on your phone. That's pretty compelling.
* **NameDrop and Contact Posters.** Sharing your contact information with other iPhone users is as simple as tapping phones together, thanks to[NameDrop](https://www.lifewire.com/use-namedrop-on-iphone-7555049) . You can share stylishly designed contact info with[Contact Posters](https://www.lifewire.com/make-contact-poster-on-iphone-7555045) .
* **Live voicemail transcription.** With iOS 17, you can send a call to voicemail and then[read a transcription of the voicemail on your lock screen](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-live-voicemail-transcription-7555036) . If you want to talk to the person, you can interrupt the voicemail and join the phone call.
* **Updated security and privacy.** Every new iOS version brings numerous security and privacy enhancements and fixes. In our opinion, the importance of these changes alone is enough to justify an upgrade.

 Bottom line: If your phone is compatible, you should almost certainly update to iOS 17\. There's very little downside, and you get a lot.

### Reasons Not to Update to iOS 17

 There's only one reason to avoid updating to iOS 17\. If your phone is one of the older models on the list in the next section, putting the latest software on older hardware could make the phone slower.

 That won't happen in all cases, but it might. It's unlikely the phone would become unusable, but it could be bothersome, depending on the impact.

 If you upgrade to iOS 17 and then want to go back to iOS 16, you can[downgrade iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/downgrade-from-ios-15-to-ios-14-5197764) (the article is about iOS 14 and 15, but the basic concepts apply to iOS 16 and 17).  

 Here's something else to consider: iOS 18 is being released in September 2024 when we expect the new iPhone to be released (iPhone 16). If you haven't upgraded to iOS 17 yet, you might want to just skip it and move to 18 when it becomes available.
