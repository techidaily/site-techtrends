## How to Reactivate Your Snapchat Account on the Web

 Snapchat has a dedicated web page on Snapchat.com where you can[delete your Snapchat account](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-snapchat-account-4692675) . Once you enter your credentials to confirm account deletion, Snapchat will temporarily deactivate your account for 30 days.

 Within those 30 days, you can reactivate your account by going to[Snapchat on the web](https://web.snapchat.com/) and signing in with your username and password.

## Waiting for Your Snapchat Account to Be Reactivated

 According to Snapchat, it can take up to 24 hours for an account to reactivate. Accounts with a lot of data to recover (including friends, conversations, saved chats, Memories, and more) may take the longest to reactivate.

 If you submitted your account for deletion and tried to reactivate it shortly after that, Snapchat may not have completed the deactivation process before you tried reactivating again. If you verified your email address, you should have received an email confirming deletion/deactivation.

 If, after more than 24 hours of waiting, you still can't log into your Snapchat account,[try these Snapchat troubleshooting tips](https://www.lifewire.com/is-snapchat-not-working-or-is-it-just-you-4174077) or try[reaching out to Snapchat customer service](https://www.lifewire.com/contact-snapchat-customer-service-4584117) to get their support team to look into the issue for you.

 FAQ

* How do I unlock a permanently locked Snapchat account?  
 If Snapchat has locked your account for violating the platform's terms of service, you won't be able to unlock it. To start, you should try deleting any unauthorized third-party Snapchat clients, and then sign in at[Snapchat's account page](https://accounts.snapchat.com) and click**Unlock My Account** . Otherwise, your account is gone; you may be able to set up a new one, but you'll have to start over completely.
* How do I delete a Snapchat account on my phone?  
 You can't delete your Snapchat account through the app, but you can do it through a web browser on your phone. Go to the accounts page (accounts.snapchat.com), and then select**Delete My Account** . Enter your login info again to confirm, and Snapchat will delete your account in 30 days.
