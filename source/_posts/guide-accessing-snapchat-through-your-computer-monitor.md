##  How to Get Snapchat on a Computer 

 Snapchat for Web is the company's web app. It's the easiest way to use Snapchat from a computer because there's no app to install; just[ log in to your account at web.snapchat.com](http://web.snapchat.com/) . All your existing messages will show up instantly.  

 This version of Snapchat is only available on a computer (not your phone or computer) and only through the Chrome, Edge, and Safari browsers.[ Update your web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/free-software-updater-programs-2625200) if you can't log in.

 The other way Snapchat works from a computer is via the Windows app. It's the same web.snapchat.com page, but accessible via a handy shortcut like your other apps. You can[ install Snapchat from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pf9rtkmmq69) if you have Windows 10 or newer.

##  What Can I Do With Snapchat on the Web? 

 Using Snapchat on a computer isn't all that different from using the app. Messages are synced with your online account, so existing conversations are available right away and you can start new ones with friends.

 You can react and reply to messages like you can in the app. The save option is also supported, and you can delete your own messages.

 Both video and audio calls are supported using your webcam. Text and emojis can be shared in a conversation and you can also send new snaps and share pictures stored on your computer. Spotlight and[ Stories](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-snapchat-story-3486000) are also accessible through the web app.

 However, the online version of Snapchat doesn't support all the same functions you might be used to with the app.

 For example, you can't access Snap Map on Snapchat for Web, so if you want to see where your friends are, you'll have to get back into the mobile app. There's also no way to add new friends and a few things aren't customizable, like your public profile and best friend emojis.

 Despite its limitations, Snapchat works basically the same way in the web browser version. You just need to get used to the bigger user interface.

##  How Snapchat on a Computer Used to Work 

 Before Snapchat for Web, the only way you could access Snapchat on a PC was by downloading an[ Android emulator](https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-emulators-4175015) . This kind of software mimics the mobile platform so you can use Snapchat and other apps from the Google Play Store right on your desktop.[ BlueStacks](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-bluestacks-to-run-android-apps-on-windows-4770053) is a popular option.

 However, this process is no longer necessary. Plus, there are often bugs, especially when trying to use apps like Snapchat that need camera access. And for whatever reason, Snapchat worked hard to stop people from using emulators to access its services.

 Snapchat for Web has been available since 2022 and we wouldn't be surprised to see even more of the app's features make their way into the online version.
