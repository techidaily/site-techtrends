## Resolving the 504 Gateway Timeout Issue: A Comprehensive Guide
 The 504 Gateway Timeout error is an[HTTP status code](https://www.lifewire.com/http-status-codes-2625907) that means that one server didn't receive a timely response from another server that it was accessing while attempting to load the web page or fill another request by the browser.  

## How to Fix the 504 Gateway Timeout Error

1. Retry the web page by selecting the refresh/reload button, pressing**F5** , or trying the[URL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-url-2626035) from the address bar again.  
 Even though the 504 Gateway Timeout error is reporting an error outside of your control, it might only be temporary.
2. [Restart all of your network devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . Temporary problems with your modem,[router](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-router-2618162) ,[switches](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-network-switch-817588) , or other networking[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) could be causing the 504 Gateway Timeout issue you're seeing. Just restarting these devices could help.  
 While the order you turn_off_ these devices isn't important, the order that you turn them back_on_ is. In general, you want to turn devices on from the outside-in. If you're not sure what that means, check out the link at the beginning of this step for a complete tutorial.
3. Check the proxy server settings in your browser or application and make sure they're correct. Incorrect proxy settings can cause 504 errors.  
 Most computers don't have proxy settings at all, so if yours are empty, just skip this step.  
 See Proxy.org for an updated, respected list of proxy servers that you can choose from.
4. [Change your DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-server-settings-2617979) , especially if all the devices on your network are getting the same error. It's possible that the 504 Gateway Timeout error you're seeing is caused by an issue with the[DNS servers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-server-2625854) you happen to be using.  
 Unless you've previously changed them, the DNS servers you have configured right now are probably the ones automatically assigned by your[ISP](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) . Others are also available to choose from. See our [Free & Public DNS Servers](https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062) list for options.
5. Contact the website. Website administrators may already be working to fix the root cause of the error, assuming they're aware of it, but there's nothing wrong touching base with them.  
 Most major sites have social networking accounts they use to help support their services, and some have telephone numbers and email addresses.
6. Contact your internet service provider. It's very likely at this point, after following all the troubleshooting above, that the 504 Gateway Timeout that you're seeing is a problem caused by a network issue that your ISP is responsible for.

7. Come back later. You've exhausted all your options at this point and the 504 Gateway Timeout error is either in the hands of the website or your ISP to correct. Check back with the site regularly. No doubt it'll start working again soon.

## Fixing 504 Errors on Your Own Site

 A lot of times this_isn't_ your fault at all, but it's not the user's either. Start by checking that your server can properly resolve all the domains that your applications require access to.

 Very heavy traffic might result in your server serving a 504 error, even though a 503 would probably be a bit more accurate.

1. In WordPress specifically,_504: Gateway Timeout_ messages are sometimes due to corrupted databases. Install[WP-DBManager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dbmanager/) and then try the "Repair DB" feature, followed by "Optimize DB," and see if that helps.
2. Also, make sure your[HTACCESS](https://www.lifewire.com/htaccess-file-2621687) file is correct, especially if you have just reinstalled WordPress.
3. Finally, consider contacting your hosting company. It's possible that the 504 error that your website is returning is due to an issue on their end that they'll need to resolve.

## How You Might See the 504 Error as a User

 A 504 Gateway Timeout error can appear in any internet browser, on any[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , and on any device. Individual websites can customize how they show "gateway timeout" errors, but here are the most common ways you'll see one:

* 504 Gateway Timeout
* HTTP 504
* 504 ERROR
* Gateway Timeout (504)
* HTTP Error 504 - Gateway Timeout
* Gateway Timeout Error

 A 504 Gateway Timeout error shows up inside the internet browser window, just like normal web pages do. There might be a site's familiar headers and footers and a nice, English message on the page, or it could show up on an all-white page with a big**504** at the top. It's all the same message, regardless of how the website happens to show it.

## More Ways You Might See a 504 Error in Windows

 A Gateway Timeout error, when received in[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) , generates a 0x80244023 error code or the message**_WU\_E\_PT\_HTTP\_STATUS\_GATEWAY\_TIMEOUT_** .

 In Windows-based programs that inherently access the internet, a 504 error might show up in a small dialog box or window with the**HTTP\_STATUS\_GATEWAY\_TIMEOUT** error and/or with a_The request was timed out waiting for a gateway_ message.

 A less common 504 error is _Gateway Time-out: The proxy server did not receive a timely response from the upstream server_ , but the troubleshooting (above) remains the same.

## Causes of 504 Gateway Timeout Errors

 Most of the time, a 504 Gateway Timeout error means that whatever other server is taking so long that it's "timing out," is probably down or not working properly.

 Since this error is usually a network error between servers on the internet or an issue with an actual server, the problem probably isn't with your computer, device, or internet connection.

 That said, there are a few things you can try, just in case:

 FAQ

* How do I fix Error 504 on an Android device?  
 You can try a few other things if you see Error 504 on an Android phone or tablet. If you're using cellular data, try switching to Wi-Fi, and vice-versa. Otherwise, just like on a desktop or laptop, you'll likely just have to wait for the site admins to fix the issue.
* What does "Error 503: first byte timeout" mean?  
 The 503 group of errors is similar to the 504, but this one specifically refers to information taking too long to travel between the server and the user. The default "time limit" before this error appears is 15 seconds. To resolve it, try logging out and back in to the site you're on (if applicable), restarting your browser and computer, and checking for updates to browser extensions you may be running, like Java.
