 However, these exciting features have a cost in that their implementation requires that the games be online at all times to function correctly.

 Thankfully, several good offline racing games are still worth playing on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles. Here are ten free offline titles worth downloading today.

 What We Like

* An impressive amount of content for a free game.
* Good variety of locations for each race track.

 What We Don't Like

* Younger players may tap in-game ads accidentally.
* The realistic art style may not appeal to all players.

 The Asphalt racing games are easily some of the most popular offline car games on iOS and Android._Asphalt 8: Airborne_ is one of the best in the series, as it features over 220 cars and bikes and lets players play entirely offline.

 A newer Asphalt game,_Asphalt 9: Legends_ , is available, but it requires a constant online connection.

_Asphalt 8: Airborne_ does contain an online multiplayer mode, but its single-player career mode is entirely playable without connecting to a Wi-Fi signal.

**Download For:** 

[ iOS ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-8-airborne/id610391947?platform=iphone)

High Score Hero

 What We Like

 What We Like

* Game modes and upgradable vehicles offer variety.

 What We Like

* Focus on drifting sets this game apart.
* Cool music with a high production value.

 What We Don't Like

* Casual gamers will find this game hard or frustrating.
* Main menu can be a bit confusing to navigate at first.

_CarX Drift Racing 2_ features a realistic visual style that resembles the_Forza_ and_Asphalt_ car racing games but sets itself apart by its challenging driving style that incorporates slippery roads and requires frequent drifting to make it to the finish line.

 Naturally, online multiplayer is unavailable while offline, but the Drift, Time Attack, and Training modes are fully accessible and provide a lot of content for those who like this particular driving style.
