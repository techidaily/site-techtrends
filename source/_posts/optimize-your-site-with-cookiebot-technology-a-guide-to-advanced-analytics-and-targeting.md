## What are e-invoices, and why do they matter?

E-invoices, or [electronic invoices](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), are digital invoices that are sent and received electronically. They are typically XML-based and can follow different standards, such as PEPPOL, ZUGFeRD, or Facturae, depending on the country or region of the invoice issuer.

With regulatory mandates gaining traction globally, e-invoicing is becoming essential. These mandates aim to streamline VAT collection and enhance transaction transparency, providing reliable, traceable data on transactions and tax obligations.

**Key benefits of e-invoices over paper invoices:**

* **Eco-friendly:** Save paper, ink, and energy.
* **Cost-efficient:** Cut down on printing, mailing, and storage expenses.
* **Speedy processing:** Accelerate payment cycles by eliminating manual data entry.
* **Accuracy and compliance:** Minimize human errors and fraud.
* **Customer satisfaction:** Deliver timely, transparent invoicing.

However, e-invoices also pose some challenges for businesses, especially if they must deal with multiple formats, standards, and languages. 

How can organizations ensure that they can receive, process, and pay all the e-invoices they receive from their suppliers, regardless of their origin and format? How can [logistics processes run smoothly](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) with digital and physical documents at every turn? How can businesses avoid compatibility issues, data loss, or errors that can lead to delays, penalties, or disputes?

## How AI can help you process e-invoices

The ultimate ally in handling the diverse complexities of invoice processing, regardless of origin, format, or language, is a purpose-built AI solution. ABBYY's [Document AI technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) automates and streamlines your invoicing workflows, minimizing errors and costs while enhancing compliance and satisfaction.

Here’s how ABBYY’s Document AI works its magic

* **Universal data extraction and validation:** Utilizing optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) to deliver an IDP (intelligent document processing) solution, ABBYY extracts and validates data from any e-invoice format or language, converting it into a standardized format compatible with your accounting or ERP system.
* **Smart classification:** Document AI categorizes e-invoices by content (invoice number, date, amount, etc.) and matches them with purchase orders, contracts, or delivery notes, flagging discrepancies.
* **Automated workflows:** AI-driven approval and payment processes follow predefined rules, sending notifications to stakeholders and tracking e-invoice statuses.
* **Insightful analytics:** Gain insights into your e-invoice processing, including metrics on volume, value, processing time, compliance rates, and customer satisfaction. Identify and optimize bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
