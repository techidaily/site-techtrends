##  How to Capture 4K HDR Screenshots and Video Clips on Xbox One

 Xbox One S and Xbox One X allow you to capture screenshots and gameplay footage in 4k. 

 If your Xbox One is capable of outputting[ 4K video](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , and your television is capable of displaying 4K, then you can capture screenshots and video in 4K. If your television has[ high dynamic range](https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427) (HDR) enabled, your captures will also reflect the improved contrast.

 To capture media in 4K you have to change your Xbox One capture settings:

1. Press the**Xbox button** .
2. Navigate to**System** \>**Settings** .
3. Select**Preferences** \>**Broadcast & Capture** \>**Game clip resolution** .
4. Select one of the 4K options.

 This will dramatically increase the file size of screenshots and video clips. If you want to share your 4K screenshots on social media platforms like X, you may need to download them to your PC and then[ resize the images](https://www.lifewire.com/resize-pictures-before-inserting-1173273) .
