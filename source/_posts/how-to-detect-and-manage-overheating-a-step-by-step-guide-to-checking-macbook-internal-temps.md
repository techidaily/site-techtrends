## How Do I Know if My Mac Is Overheating?

 If you're worried your Mac is overheating, there are some simple precautions you can take to avoid the issue. Here's a look at some of the key ways to prevent your Mac from overheating.  
 Not all of these fixes will work if there's a hardware fault on your Mac.  

* **Make sure your Mac is up to date.** Apple releases regular firmware updates for Macs, and it's essential to keep up to date, so your device runs optimally.  
* **Avoid using it in hot locations.** Don't leave your MacBook in a parked car when the weather is hot outside, and avoid using it in high humidity situations.  
* **Use your Mac on a stable work surface.** Ensure your Mac has good ventilation at all times and avoid using it on your bed, a pillow, or under covers.  
* **Don't cover it.** Don't cover your MacBook with anything that could block its fans or cause it to overheat.  
* **Only use Apple-authorized power adapters.** Avoid using unofficial power adapters that may be unsafe.  
* **Restart your Mac occasionally.** If your Mac seems to be struggling and you can hear the fans whirring a lot, try restarting it or switch it off for a time to give it a break.  
 FAQ  
* How do I check the CPU temperature of a MacBook Air?  
    The methods listed above will work for checking the CPU temperature of a MacBook Air. Alternatively,[download the iStat Menus app](https://apps.apple.com/app/istat-menus/id1319778037?mt=12) to monitor your Mac's stats, including CPU temperature, continuously.  
* What is the highest safe temperature for a Mac CPU?  
    There's no one-size-fits-all answer for safe operating temperature, as "normal" CPU temperatures vary by processor, outside temperatures, and whether the device is idle or working at full load. Generally, if your MacBook has the M1 chip or the Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, the CPU can safely reach temperatures of 100 degrees Celsius. Apple advises that the ideal ambient temperature when using a MacBook can range from 50 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Consider testing your MacBook's temperature when it's idle and then under a full load.
