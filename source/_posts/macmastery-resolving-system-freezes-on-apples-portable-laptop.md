 Miguel, Bobby, and Luis are a bunch of normal teens with an unusual problem—vampires have invaded their Bronx community and are eating their neighbors.

 Plucky teens protect their neighborhood from invading monsters is not a new concept._Vampires vs. the Bronx_ wears that trope like a comfy blanket. But in between the fun frights and the witty one-liners is a clever meditation on gentrification and whitewashing.

 While visiting his family in Mexico, Alex (Evan Whitten) meets a baby chupacabra. Although he believes Chupacabras to be ferocious, Chupa is adorable and friendly, so Alex vows to protect his new friend from the scientists who want to experiment on him.
