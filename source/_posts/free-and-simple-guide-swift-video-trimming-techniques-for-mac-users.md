## Why You Need Trim/Cut/Split Video Clips?

Firstly, this is closely related to your ultimate goals. In other words, it depends on what will you do with the video. Generally, the reasons why people cut their videos come that they want to: 

**• Upload videos to the web.** Video sharing sites has its requirement of the video length, for example, Facebook allows video no longer than 120 minutes, Basic YouTube account accepts videos shorter than 15 minutes, and Instagram supports video of 60 seconds at most. So it's advisable to cut and [edit video for Insta](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), YouTube, Facebook, and the like. 

**• Reduce size for storage.** If you have a limited capacity, like 64GB iPhone, 5GB free storage iCloud space, or a slightly small hard drive, you can cut videos to remove the non-significant parts to [reduce the video file size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for storage. 

**• Remove the cruft for a perfect flow.** It's inevitable that your recordings are interrupted by unexpected conditions, such as the flickering light, the passersby, or the elusive weather. To ensure a perfect flow, you need cut all these least anticipates out.

**• Send videos by email or social media.** No matter you'd like share videos with your friends by sending emails or through social media, you have to compress video firstly since they have no access for large videos. For example, Whatsapp allows for videos smaller than 16MB. And video trimming is undoubtedly the most direct way to get it smaller.

**• Burn video to DVD discs.** There are mainly four sizes for DVDs, DVD-5 (4.37GB), DVD-9(7.95GB), DVD-10(8.75GB), DVD-18(15.9GB). If you'd like burn your large-sized 4K UHD videos to DVD, you do need a [4K video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to cut 4K videos within the DVD size limits.

Besides, it has something to do with video sources. I mean people get videos in various ways, like record video with DSLR cameras, GoPro, mobiles, download videos from online, or rip videos from DVD, leading a variety of video codecs and formats. Thus to achieve all the goals above, you're asked not only to cut video on Mac, but also a step of re-encoding videos for wide compatibility. 

## How to Cut Video on MacOS? Three Ways!

## To The Conclusion

You see, each way could get video cut/trimmed, but various in the degree of completion. Online video cutter requires Internet connection and you cannot cut video of large file size and high definition. Photos and QuickTime Player can trim video on Mac without quality loss, but no further cutting features like split, and splice trimmed clips together. iMovie gives your more options for video editing, yet that could be complicated and the degraded video quality and the error of failing export may make you depressed. Moreover, it's too rigid for VLC video cutting. If you're going to cut a GoPro Hero 6 recorded 4K UHD video, which gets choppy on your earlier version Macbook, VLC is totally inappropriate for this task since it will record the choppy frames as well in your trimmed video. 

Therefore, why not use macXvideo to cut videos on Mac at a quite clip easily and no quality loss? It accepts a wide range of videos, from SD, 720p/1080p HD, 2K, to 4K UHD and even 8K in all common used codecs and formats. And you have an option of re-encoding or not before cutting. The unique video re-encoding option helps you [resize video smaller](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) but same high quality. As for video cutting, you're able to trim video length, split video into clips, merge the trimmed video together and crop the video dimensions etc.
