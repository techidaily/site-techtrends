### MacX Video Converter Pro

Handbrake extracting MP3 from video

As an open source tool, there is no one better than Handbrake on ripping DVD and converting video from format to format, even extracting MP3 from video. It's totally free to switch video to audio in MP3 at express speed with alterable audio quality, which saves your converting time and ensures the high quality of the target MP3 audio. However, Handbrake is not a so professional video to MP3 converter for Mac because it has no direct output option of MP3 so that you can only select MP3 format under the option of MP4 which makes Handbrake a little bit complex.

### VLC
