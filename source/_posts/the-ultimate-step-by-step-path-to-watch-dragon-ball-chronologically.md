##  How Should I Watch Dragon Ball? 

 Based on Akira Toriyama’s manga series of the same name, Dragon Ball is one of the most popular and influential anime franchises in the world. Numerous sequels, spinoffs, and feature films have been released since Toei Animation’s_Dragon Ball_ premiered in Japan in 1986, which makes watching it all an enormous undertaking. 

 Fortunately, there are a few different ways to watch Dragon Ball. While you can go the completionist route, a large portion of the franchise isn’t considered canon so you can save a lot of time if you cut out non-canon content. However, you’ll also miss some of Dragon Ball’s most creative and epic moments if you go this route so you might be better off doing a chronological viewing and deciding for yourself how much you’d like to watch.

##  How to Watch Dragon Ball in Canonical Order 

 If you’re just looking for the “core” Dragon Ball experience, a canonical viewing is the way to go. This viewing order cuts out the movies, as well as a few series like_Dragon Ball GT_ . Consider this Goku and the Z Fighters’ main story.

 One important consideration you’ll need to make is whether to watch_Dragon Ball Z_ or_Dragon Ball Z Kai_ . The former is the original anime that ran from 1989 - 1996, while the latter is an updated version of the same series with remastered picture and sound, as well as a more streamlined story that cuts out much of the filler material found in_Dragon Ball Z_ . 

 It’s debatable which is better—_Kai_ is higher-quality in several ways but lacks some of the charm of_Dragon Ball Z’s_ wackier excursions. You could always hop back and forth to decide which you prefer but it’s arguably worth sticking to one since there’s so much overlap.

##  How to Watch Dragon Ball in Chronological Order 

 If you want to expand beyond the canonical texts, you might prefer watching Dragon Ball in chronological order. This viewing incorporates all of the movies and inserts them roughly where they would take place in the main series canon. It also means stopping and re-starting_Dragon Ball Z_ at numerous points, so keep this in mind if you want to stick to the suggested viewing order. 

 To simplify things,_Dragon Ball Z_ has been incorporated into this viewing order and not_Dragon Ball Z Kai_ . You can still complete this viewing with_Kai_ instead, but the specific episode numbers will be different than those listed below.
