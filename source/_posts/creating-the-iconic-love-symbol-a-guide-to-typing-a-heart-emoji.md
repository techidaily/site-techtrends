## What Is the Alt Code for a Heart?

 You can type out a heart symbol instantly on Windows if you know the[alt code](https://www.lifewire.com/typing-symbols-characters-on-windows-mac-4691496) .

 Things work a little differently on Macs, as the Apple keyboard uses option keys to insert symbols. However, you‚Äôll have to change your keyboard settings to use the Unicode Hex Input method to do this.

1. Hold down the**Windows key+Ctrl+O** to open the Windows 10 on-screen keyboard.
2. Click**Options** .
3. Check**Turn on numeric key pad** .
