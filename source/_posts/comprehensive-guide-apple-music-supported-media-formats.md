## Apple Music Audio Video Format 

### Apple Music Audio format 

High audio quality together with rich song resources is a key selling point of Apple Music. Apple hasn't announced Apple music format officially, but we can take an educated guess that Apple Music file format would be no different with [iTunes file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Measuring up against Spotify that is streamed at 320kbps in Ogg Vorbis format, Apple Music uses **256kbps AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)**. Apple Music file type 256kbps AAC is the same with 320kbps MP3 in quality. In fact, human hear can hardly recognize the difference between 256kbps AAC Apple Music offers, 320kbps Ogg, 256kbps [M4A](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), and 320kbps MP3.

**Apple Music video format**: MP4, MOV, M4V

## Apple Music Format AAC vs Spotify OGG, which Sounds Better? 

Many users say that 256kbps AAC format offered by Apple Music is better than 320kbps OGG that paid Spotify users can get, but the fact is that each has its own advantages. Format and bit rate are not the only factors to consider when judging audio quality. Actually, for most people, there is no discernable difference between Apple Music 256kbps AAC file format and Spotify 320kbps OGG music format. Both of them produce pretty high audio quality. If you are using apple devices to play music, Apple Music's AAC file type is definitely suited the best for 256kbps AAC format takes less data usage, and Apple users have access to airplay AAC songs to Apple TV. And not all Ogg songs on Spotify are in 320kbps high quality.
