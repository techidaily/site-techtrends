## How to Watch X-Men Movies in Order of Release

 The_X-Men_ films from 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios under Disney) were trailblazers for superhero films. However, with so many changing hands and visions in the course of two decades, the viewing order for the series and the larger X-Men timeline as a whole is a bit muddy.

 By far the most coherent way to watch the X-Men films is in the order of their theatrical and home releases. From there, you can witness how the franchise evolved and changed in style.

| **Movie**                    | **Release Date** | **Where to Watch** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |

| _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_   | May 2009         | Disney+            |

| _Deadpool 2_                 | May 2018         | Disney+            |
| _Dark Phoenix_               | June 2019        | Disney+            |

20th Century Fox

 Want to watch the X-Men films in the order in which they take place? It's a complicated ordeal, with retcons, time travel, and continuity errors. Here's our best shot at making sense of the tangled timeline.
