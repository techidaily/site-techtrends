## The Future of AI Search Engines - What to Expect From OpenAI on May 13Th, Beyond Just ChatGPT

As rumors of a GPT-powered search engine continue to rock the web, OpenAI now confirms that it will livestream a "Spring Updates" press event on Monday, May 13th. But the company wants to clear the air of all rumors—"not a search engine," says CEO Sam Altman.

 Earlier this year, _[The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-develops-web-search-product-in-challenge-to-google)_ reported that OpenAI is in the process of building a GPT-powered search engine. The story was corroborated by a separate _[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/openai-is-readying-an-ai-search-product-to-rival-google-perplexity)_ report on May 7th, and _[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/)_ came out of nowhere three days later to say that the AI search engine would debut May 13th.

 OpenAI announced its "Spring Updates" event after _Reuters_ published its story. And, within an hour, Google's share price began to falter. OpenAI may have failed to anticipate the impact of its rumored search engine, as OpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://www.howtogeek.com/openai-may-13th-event/ttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1788989777452408943) quickly popped out of the woodwork to explain that a search engine will not be featured at the May 13th event. He went on to comment that "we've been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love."

 Sam Altman also took the opportunity to squash rumors of a GPT-5 model. We'll get new improvements for ChatGPT and GPT-4, but there won't be a new, next-gen LLM.

 In any case, OpenAI has already made its mark on search engines. Microsoft began integrating GPT-4 [with Bing](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/seamless-driver-installation-for-epson-devices-on-your-pc-with-windows/) in February 2023, leading to speculation that Google Search would become obsolete. Naturally,, Google dove in headfirst and developed its own "Search Generative Experience."

 The idea of an OpenAI search engine isn't too farfetched. Rival companies like [Perplexity](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-live-tweeting-tactics/) have already made the plunge, launching unique AI-powered search tools that stand apart from Google and Bing. That's one of the interesting things about this story—OpenAI is in a unique position to redefine search because it isn't hampered by the weight of "traditional" search functionality. Google Search, on the other hand, is nearly 30 years old and can only stray so far from its roots.

 OpenAI says it won't announce a search engine on Monday. And for all we know, the company may not even be working on a search engine. But if a tiny little "GPT search engine" rumor can create rumbles across the industry, it may be a sign that Google's influence is waning. I should point out that OpenAI's event is scheduled exactly one day before [Google I/O](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-picture-in-progressive-mode-on-chrome-across-platforms/), which will also be filled with AI announcements.
