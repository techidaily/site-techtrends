### What to Know

* With Notifier for Gmail installed, select**Extensions** next to the Chrome navigation bar.
* Choose**Options** and select**Play alert sound for new emails** in the Notifications section.
* Change the sound in the drop-down menu and exit.

 This article explains how to enable Gmail sound notifications using the Notifier for Gmail extension for Chrome. It includes information for enabling a pop-up notification for Gmail and sound notifications for other email providers.

## How to Enable a New Mail Sound for Gmail

 If you want to hear a new email sound when you use Gmail in your desktop web browser, you can make that happen—just not in Gmail itself.

 Since Gmail doesn't support pushing sound notifications through a web browser, you must install a third-party program like[Notifier for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-gmail/dcjichoefijpinlfnjghokpkojhlhkgl?hl=en) (a Chrome extension).

 If you're using the Notifier for Gmail Chrome extension:

1. Select**Extensions** next to Chrome's navigation bar, then select**More actions** (three vertical dots) and choose **Options** .

EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.
