## A Quick Glance at Prime Day History

 Amazon introduced Prime Day on July 15, 2015 in honor of its 20th birthday. Since then, it has become a yearly event that takes place in July.

 One exception was in 2020, when Amazon shifted the event to October in 19 countries due to the COVID pandemic.  
  
 If the previous years are an indication, Amazon Prime Day begins on the second Tuesday in July. However, this isn’t a guarantee; it's just a pattern of past Prime Day events.

## How Long Does It Last?

 In its first two years, 2015 and 2016, Amazon Prime Day lasted just one day. Beginning in 2017, Amazon extended the deals to cover two full days, and it has remained that way since, although the name, "Amazon Prime_Day_ ," hasn’t changed.  
  
 The event usually starts at 12:00 a.m. PDT (3:00 a.m. EDT) on the first day and ends at 11:59 p.m. PDT on the second, giving you a full 48 hours of shopping time.

## When Is the Next Amazon Prime Day?

 In 2024, Prime Days will be held July 15 and 16.

 Normally held in July, Amazon selects the exact days for Amazon Prime Day only about a month or two ahead of time. So, you’ll have to be on the lookout for the current year’s dates, and luckily, you have a few handy ways to do so.
