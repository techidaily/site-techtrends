## What Did Apple Announce at WWDC 2024?

 Apple's announcements at WWDC 2024 covered almost its entire product line. Here are some highlights:

### Apple Intelligence

 We'd long heard rumors about the so-called[Apple GPT](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-gpt-7571221) , and it's coming in the form of Apple Intelligence. This platform will launch in beta form this fall (probably alongside the rest of the OS updates) and will work across and with iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Here are the compatible devices:

* **iMac** : M1 and later
* **iPad Air** : M1 and later
* **iPad Pro** : M1 and later
* **iPhone 15** : Pro and Pro Max
* **Mac Mini** : M1 and later
* **Mac Pro** : M2 Ultra
* **Mac Studio** : M1 Max and later
* **MacBook Air** : M1 and later
* **MacBook Pro** : M1 and later

 Generally, you'll need an iPhone 15 Pro or a device that runs on Apple Silicon (M chips) to use Apple Intelligence.

 As for what Apple Intelligence does? It can do text and image generation, interact with ChatGPT, and study your habits to make Apple's various operating systems more efficient.

### iOS 18

 The big updates to[iOS 18](https://www.lifewire.com/ios-18-8552216) include the ability to personalize your Home screen, including app layout, icon size, and color, along with a hugely updated Control Center.

 The Photos app is also overhauled and includes new topics that your phone will auto-filter for you. There's also a new carousel that updates daily with new, featured images.

 Messages updates let you stylize text with bold, italics, underlines, and more; you can also schedule texts to be delivered later. The app will also support RCS for better texting with Android owners.

### iPadOS 18

 The iPad is getting the same updates to Photos, Messages, and more as iOS.[iPadOS 18](https://www.lifewire.com/ipados-18-8558715) also has its own upgrades, like a Notes app that will clean up your handwriting. The refined Calculator app will also show a history of your calculations and solves equations as you type or write them.

### macOS 15 (Sequoia)

 Macs will also get some new abilities with[macOS 15, named Sequoia](https://www.lifewire.com/macos-15-8557761) . The big news here is iPhone integration. You can get app notifications directly on your Mac and even run your phone directly from the bigger screen.

 Window tiling is also getting an update. Instead of arranging windows to the left or right, you can put them in the corners, which means you can quickly tile four apps or documents at a time. Holding down the Option key shows you some layout options.

### tvOS 18

 The[new tvOS](https://www.lifewire.com/tvos-18-8599054) aims to be smarter with audio. If you have a 4K Apple TV, you can use improved dialogue boosting using machine learning to make sure you can always tell what people are saying. This feature will also work with external speakers and receivers and not just HomePods.

 Another big feature in tvOS 18 is InSight. If you're watching a show or movie on Apple TV+ and wonder who an actor is or need help identifying a song that's playing, a swipe will provide you that information. From there, you can add songs you like to an Apple Music playlist or see what else actors were in.

### visionOS 2

 The second version of[the software that runs the Vision Pro headset](https://www.lifewire.com/visionos-2-8604723) focuses on spatial photos. It'll make your 2D images look 3D and place them dynamically in your background.

 The virtual monitor that provides a workspace when you're wearing the Vision Pro is also getting bigger and higher-resolution, equivalent to two 4K monitors placed side-by-side.

### watchOS 11

 Finally, there's[watchOS 11](https://www.lifewire.com/watchos-11-8552217) , which powers Apple's line of smartwatches. They're getting similar customization options to iOS and iPadOS, including text, font size, and color. The Translate app is also moving to your wrist, and it works with 20 languages.

 You'll also be able to pause your Fitness Rings if you aren't able to fill them for a while.

 The new Vitals app will track your baseline health while you're sleeping and give you tips and alerts if it notices anything change.

 Finally, the Training Load option is for athletes preparing for events. It keeps an eye on your workouts and identifies trends to make sure you're making progress and not overdoing it.
