## How to Connect Your AirPods to a MacBook Air

 Connecting AirPods to a MacBook Air is pretty simple. In a few clicks and button presses and you'll be listening to wireless audio. Here's what to do:

 If you've already[connected these AirPods to an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-airpods-with-iphone-and-ipad-4136767) , and the iPhone and MacBook Air are signed in to the same iCloud account, you should be able to skip these steps. The AirPods should already be set up on the Mac: Put the AirPods in your ears and click the**Bluetooth** menu > your**AirPods** \>**Connect** .

1. Click the**Apple** menu in the top left corner, then click**System Settings or System Preferences** .  
![System Settings from the Apple menu in macOS.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RV3WC-OSvMcKyguMtnNOLltQpxk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_connect-airpods-to-macbook-air-5188769-8bd1663aa3354508b8e8efb92e8af0ad.jpg)
2. Click**Bluetooth** . Toggle Bluetooth on or click**Turn Bluetooth On** . Keep this window open for the next few steps.

3. With both AirPods in the charging case, open the lid. Press the button on the AirPods case until the status light starts to blink.

4. The AirPods will appear in the Bluetooth preferences window. Click**Connect** .  

![The Connect button for an available set of AirPods Pro in macOS Bluetooth settings.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KG0yU2YAi6Ct5NjtMCIkdfyAA7w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_connect-airpods-to-macbook-air-5188769-baf578afb7944e938c59b082037e82d4.jpg)
5. In a moment, the AirPods will be connected to your MacBook Air and you'll be ready to listen to audio.  

 To use the AirPods with your MacBook Air in the future, you won't need all of these steps. By default, your AirPods should connect automatically or when last connected to your Mac. If they don't, connect them from the**Control Center** \>**Bluetooth** or from the Bluetooth settings menu.

## Can You Connect Two Pairs of AirPods to One MacBook Air?

 Got a friend who wants to hear whatever you're listening to? You can connect two pairs of AirPods to one MacBook Air. To do so, follow the steps from the last section to connect both sets of AirPods to the MacBook Air.

 Now, things get a little more complicated. Because the macOS doesn't support audio output to two pairs of AirPods, you need a workaround. Here's what to do:

1. Go to the**Finder** \>**Utilities** \> and launch**Audio MIDI Setup** .  
![The Audio MIDI Setup app from the Utilities folder in macOS.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hDuapYeU0qS6jTic9j1qPLdfWRg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_connect-airpods-to-macbook-air-5188769-1ed53dd151a7494d9e1818845e825a07.jpg)
2. Click the**\+ (Plus)** sign, then select**Create Multi-Output Device** .

3. Check the box next to the two sets of AirPods. In the**Master Device** drop-down, choose your AirPods. Check the**Drift Correction** box next to your friend's AirPods.  
![AirPods selected and one set to Drift Correction in Audio MIDI Setup in macOS.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OiH8Qk5hsmap5RKxp1rTMtNuzG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/007-connect-airpods-to-macbook-air-5188769-fba01d5c7c96478f9e3070fc2bdcfa7c.jpg)
4. Go to the**Apple** menu >**System Settings** or**System Preferences** \>**Sound** \>**Output** \>**Multi-Output Device** . With that done, the MacBook Air's audio is sent to both sets of AirPods.
