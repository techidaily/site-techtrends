## All About Samsung's TV Apps: Insights & Tips
 Since Samsung's first[smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) in 2008, the company has parlayed its experience with smartphone apps as a way to expand the capability of its TVs to not only provide a viewing experience from TV broadcasts, cable, satellite, DVD, and Blu-ray discs but also access an abundance of internet streaming channels and other smart capabilities.

 To access smart features the TV needs to be connected to the internet. All Samsung smart TVs provide[Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546) and[Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) .

## Samsung's Approach to Smart TV

 Using its umbrella "Smart Hub" interface, not only does the TV viewer have efficient access to TV setup and other functions, but also streaming services like Netflix and YouTube. Depending on the TV model, it might also include a full web browser and access to social media.

![Illustration of Samsung Apps on an HDTV.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GoKWczBXBzi0TTEp01zsqYN4RWo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/what-are-samsung-apps-1847425-30802e31493c438e8455a8ca17457a38.png)

Lifewire / Maddy Price

 As of December 2019,[the Netflix app may not work](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Ftroubleshooting%2FTSG01203568%2F) on some 2010 and 2011 Samsung smart TVs. If your TV is affected, you will see a notice displayed on your screen.

## It's All About the Apps

 The idea of a smart TV in general, and Samsung's approach in particular, is to offer built-in apps that are accessible on your TV, similar to the way we use[mobile apps](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114) on a smartphone. When you look at your TV menu, it looks similar to a smartphone screen.

* The Samsung Smart TV platform has a few of the more popular apps pre-loaded, with more available that can be downloaded from the[Samsung App Store](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fbrowse%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170) .
* [Additional apps](https://www.lifewire.com/complete-guide-to-samsung-apps-1847454) are accessible via the TV's Smart Hub or onscreen menu (just look for and click the icon on the menu bar that just says "Apps" or symbol that looks like four small TV screens inside a square).
* There are lots of[TV app types](https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-samsung-tv-apps-1847418) , all categorized for easy browsing. These help you find videos, games, sports, lifestyle apps, and more.
* Additional apps that aren't listed in the provided categories may be found using Search, which is usually located in the top right corner of the Apps menu screen.
* If you find an app through a category or search that you want to add, choose it and select**Install** .

![Samsung Smart TV Add Apps Process](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W9N4q6WDI5NCqK2ochKm9BW0aQw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/samsung-smart-hub-and-apps-menus-arrows-xabc-5b4a255946e0fb003762ca90.jpg)

 Samsung Smart TV Add Apps Process.

 To[add new apps](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-samsung-apps-1847395) , you need to[make a Samsung account](https://www.lifewire.com/creating-a-samsung-account-579622) .

 Along with the popular apps that are suited to the TV’s big screen, such as Netflix, Fandango at Home, Hulu, and YouTube, there are apps for[music services](https://www.lifewire.com/top-places-to-listen-to-free-music-online-1356649) like Pandora and Spotify, and other unique apps may be based on games or apps that run on other devices. There are also apps to connect directly to your Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) accounts.

 Although most apps can be downloaded for free, some may require a small fee, and some free apps may also require additional subscription or pay-per-view fees to access content.

## Smart TV as Your Life Hub

 Samsung's goal is to enable their TVs to be the hub of our home life.

* We shouldn't have to run to our computer to check a website or get a glimpse of the weather forecast.
* We should be able to turn on the TV and have access to[online movies](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-free-movies-online-1356647) and TV without any other device.
* We should be able to get a variety of content to help us in our daily lives, from morning exercises to current traffic reports.

 Examples of how Samsung smart TV apps can assist your daily life include:

* You can turn on your Samsung TV when you get up in the morning. One app will guide you through yoga poses (such as[Bea Love Yoga](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG15224003851%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170) ), or you can opt for a more general health and fitness option with[FitFusion](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG18248011800) .
* You can switch to another app, like[AccuWeather](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2F000000019671) , and with a glance, get the hour-by-hour weather forecast for the day.
* Maybe you need[Dashwhoa](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00000416470%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170) for local traffic information, or you're in the mood for the latest business news and market reports; use an app like[Bloomberg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG14363001012%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170) or[InvestoPro](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG15240004108%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170) .
* There are also several games for adults (like[PlayWorks](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG18354012332) ), families ([Monopoly](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG15065001510) ), and kids ([Angry Birds](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00008122677) ,[Monkey Madness](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00019838109) ,[El Dorado](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG15313005147) ).
* You can also follow your favorite sports with apps like[MLB.TV](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00000210252) ,[UFC](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00001330026) , and[Fishing TV](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG00003828881) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## More Than Internet Streaming

 In addition to streaming apps, depending on the year and model, Samsung smart TV owners may be able to view content stored on network-connected PCs and media servers via[Samsung SmartView](https://www.lifewire.com/how-samsung-allshare-simplifies-media-streaming-1847358) .

 What this means is that the TV is not just a way to receive TV programs over-the-air, cable/satellite, but also to stream media from your home network and the internet without the need to connect an additional external device like a[Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) or[Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213) .

 There's also a[remote access feature on Samsung TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/use-remote-access-samsung-smart-tv-4688935) that lets you use your computer directly from your TV.

## Smart Home Control

 Samsung has taken the "hub of our home life" concept even further with its[SmartThings platform](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-samsung-smartthings-app-5104981) , which allows select Samsung smart TVs to be used to assist in controlling compatible smart home devices.

 This functionality uses a combination of apps and optional external accessory devices that work together to control things such as lighting, thermostats, security devices, and appliances and view their status on the TV screen.

## App Availability

 Your TV model determines what the Smart Hub may look like, what apps may be available, and how to access and manage them. Also, some app availability may be restricted depending on the region or country.  

 Beginning with the 2018 model year, Samsung smart TVs incorporate[Bixby](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-samsung-bixby-4154184) voice control that can be used to navigate TV and content features, including app access and management. Alexa and Google Assistant support are also included on some models.

 Only Samsung 3D TVs ([no longer being made](https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776) ) are able to access apps that offer 3D content. And if you don't have a Samsung UHD LED/LCD or QLED smart TV, you can't access apps that provide[4K](https://www.lifewire.com/what-you-need-to-see-4k-1847330) content.
