##  What You Need to Get Fandango at Home 3D 

 While Fandango at Home was initially offered on its own streaming video device, the company has since made deals with manufacturers to make its platform available on a number of devices. A Fandango at Home app can be found on Samsung and LG smart TVs, Blu-ray disc players, and many[ home theater](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-home-theater-1846801) components. For more info, check out[ Fandango at Home's device page](https://support.vudu.com/vudusupport/s/article/Where-can-I-watch-Vudu-movies-and-TV-shows) .

 Note that many Blu-ray players, TVs, and media streamers do not support Fandango at Home 3D.

 Here is a list of everything you need to set up Fandango at Home 3D.

* A[ 3D-capable TV](https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776) or[ video projector](https://www.lifewire.com/what-do-i-need-to-watch-3d-1847325) .
* [ 3D glasses](https://www.lifewire.com/3d-passive-polarized-vs-active-shutter-1847836) that work with the TV or video projector.
* A[ high-speed HDMI cable](https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337) rated to handle 3D.
* A TV or other device capable of running the Fandango at Home app. (Again, note that some[ Blu-ray disc players](https://www.lifewire.com/blu-ray-disc-player-information-1846364) and the original Fandango at Home device do not support 3D.)
* A direct connection from the Fandango at Home-enabled device to a 3D TVâ€”if the Fandango at Home app is not available on the TV. This connection can also be run through a 3D capable home theater receiver.
* Fandango at Home account: There is no subscription fee; rather, users rent or purchase titles. Previews are free.
* An internet connection with[ speeds over 9 Mb/s](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-requirements-for-movie-viewing-1847401) .

##  Streaming 3D Movies in Quality That Rivals Blu-ray 

 In testing Fandango at Home 3D on a number of devices, the results were consistently impressive. Fandango at Home has been known for high-quality video and audio delivery with its HDX format, which rivals the quality of[ Blu-ray discs](https://www.lifewire.com/blu-ray-disc-player-information-1846364) . This is amazing when you consider that the media is streaming to your device rather than playing from physical media.

 Of course, the 3D effects are only as good as the 3D effects of a Blu-ray disc. With a few exceptions, most 3D creates a behind-the-screen depth rather than that jump-out-of-the-TV-and-into-your-living-room action. Disney's "The Christmas Carol" is an example where twirling snowflakes indeed seem to float out into the room.

 Streaming 3D requires an internet speed of 9 Mb/s or more, so be sure you have a fast connection before attempting to stream in 3D. It's a good idea to take up your player's offer to test your connection prior to streaming the movie or preview, to see if you might encounter any[ streaming artifacts or buffering](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-avoid-buffering-issues-1847399)

## The Bottom Line 

 If you've been looking for content to enjoy on your[ 3D TV](https://www.lifewire.com/3d-tv-pros-and-cons-1847837) , Fandango at Home 3D streaming is an option to consider. However, keep in mind that 3D movie titles are rotated in and out on a periodic basis, so if you see one listed that you would like to see, watch it when you can so you don't miss it. As 3D Blu-rays are released, you'll be able to stream the Fandango at Home 3D versions.

 Fandango at Home provides a quality online video-on-demand viewing experience. If you have a TV, media streamer, or Blu-ray Disc player that is compatible with Fandango at Home 3D streaming, it is a feature worth considering. However,[ with the discontinuation of 3D TV production](https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776) , Fandango at Home may at some point discontinue the 3D portion of its streaming service. if you are a 3D fan, take advantage of it while you can.
