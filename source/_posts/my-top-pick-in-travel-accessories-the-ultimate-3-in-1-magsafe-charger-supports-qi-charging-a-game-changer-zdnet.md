When traveling, I often find myself carrying too much charging gear. Typically, I pack a couple of chargers, a handful of cables, and a few power banks. All of this gets tossed into a zipped pouch, which I then fill with even more cables and random bits.

**Also: [Hiking this weekend? Don't forget to pack these gadgets](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/the-5-tech-gadgets-i-never-hike-without/#google%5Fvignette)**

What I really need is a dedicated travel kit for charging my gadgets, which include an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. A streamlined travel kit would save space, reduce clutter, and ensure that all my essential devices stay charged and ready to go. Recently, I found the perfect solution for my travel charging needs: the [ESR 3-in-1 Folding Qi2 wireless travel charger](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FESR-Charging-Station-Certified-Multiple%2Fdp%2FB0CW2J9XB8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C4088eb44-5f1b-4605-9239-bd7f08f8898c%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

This compact and versatile charger can simultaneously power up my iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, eliminating the need for multiple chargers and tangled cables. The folding design makes it incredibly portable, fitting neatly into the included travel pouch along with an Apple Watch charging dongle, a charger, and a USB-C-to-USB-C cable. 

This is a neat kit for traveling.

The Apple Watch charger dongle is detachable, allowing the whole unit to fold down flat for easy transportation. I also like that the Apple Watch charger has a magnetic cover for the USB-C charging port that clips to the top when in use. It's a very neat setup.

Apple Watch charging dongle.

In fact, it's the perfect kit for someone who is all-in with Apple gear. 

I've carried out all my usual tests on this charger, including safety tests and thermal checks, and it passed all of them with flying colors, which I would expect from a company such as ESR, which has a track record for making excellent charging tools.

## ZDNET's buying advice

This [ESR 3-in-1 Qi2 wireless travel charger](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FESR-Charging-Station-Certified-Multiple%2Fdp%2FB0CW2J9XB8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C4088eb44-5f1b-4605-9239-bd7f08f8898c%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is the ultimate travel companion for anyone looking to streamline their tech gear. Compact and easy to carry, it unfolds into a versatile and effective charging station. I've used this on several trips, and it has performed flawlessly every time.

One of the standout features is the carry case, which has designated spots for everything. This level of organization helps prevent you from making the costly mistake I made of leaving an expensive charger behind in a hotel room or Airbnb. It's a bit bulky, sure, but the protection and tidiness is well worth the money.
