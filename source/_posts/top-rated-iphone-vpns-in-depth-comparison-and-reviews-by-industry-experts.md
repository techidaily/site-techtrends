## Top-Rated iPhone VPN Providers: Comprehensive Analysis by Industry Experts

Now that the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/) has arrived with new colors, AI features, and camera controls -- and with it, [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ios-18-settings-i-changed-immediately-and-why-you-should-too/) \-- you may also be on the lookout for a new way to improve your online privacy. While Apple's [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) of all models and generations tend to have excellent connectivity, we always recommend using a [virtual private network (VPN) service](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-why-do-you-need-one-all-your-virtual-private-network-questions-answered/) to keep your data and browsing safe while on the go.

[Trustworthy VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) encrypt your online traffic when you access email, social media, and online services. While you're on the road or if you have to rely on public Wi-Fi hotspots, they are excellent tools for protecting your data from eavesdroppers. And if you're looking to [stream content](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-vpn/) that isn't available in your area, a VPN can potentially unlock access by changing your IP address (although this can be a legal gray area). 

We've [tested every top VPN on the market](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/#link={) and found the best ones that offer solid iPhone clients, good performance, robust security, and are suitable for the Apple ecosystem.

## What is the best iPhone VPN right now?

Based on extensive testing, our pick for the best VPN for iPhone is [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff%5Fc?aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&aff%5Fid=307&source=ZDNET&offer%5Fid=378). While it is not the cheapest service available, NordVPN is known for its rapid speeds, solid connectivity, and massive server network. Furthermore, the NordVPN iOS app (iOS 14.2 and above) is user-friendly and won't noticeably drain your battery with continual use. 

If you don't want to spend anything, the best free VPN for iPhone is [Proton VPN](https://go.getproton.me/aff%5Fc?offer%5Fid=25&aff%5Fid=4706&source=ZDNET&aff%5Fsub=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) because of its top-tier security features -- rare for a free VPN. However, know that the free version is quite limited.

## NordVPN

### Best iPhone VPN overall

NordVPN is one of the more popular VPN offerings in the App Store. [Installing NordVPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-does-nordvpn-work-plus-how-to-set-it-up-and-use-it-tutorial/) on the iPhone is a simple, painless way to secure predictable performance across regions, and the service is compatible with iOS [14.2 or later](https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordvpn-ios-release-notes/?srsltid=AfmBOooLz0K2c1gbD1Kh6356NSzMQPekth5ctCHhXog2H4POqXRaMM1Z).

NordVPN's interface is user-friendly, and during testing, we found the service offered consistent, reliable speeds that do not impact streaming services or make a noticeable difference to internet surfing. 

It has many tools in addition to a standard VPN service. NordVPN's Onion over VPN is a special category of NordVPN servers that enables Tor capabilities, supports peer-to-peer file sharing, and allows you to connect through a second server for an added layer of protection. You can also set up a dedicated IP address for an additional fee. 

We consider this VPN to be one of the best available, combining speed, server availability, reliability, and a high number of simultaneous connections. NordVPN has increased the number of simultaneous connections from six to ten devices. New server locations have also increased from 60 to 111, which now includes Greenland, the Isle of Man, Trinidad and Tobago, and Bermuda. 

We've tested NordVPN for years and have always been impressed with its stable connectivity and rapid speeds. Customers generally report fast speeds and minimal buffering with easy setup, although some caution that you should turn off auto-renewal.

**Review:** [**NordVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nord-vpn-review-an-in-depth-look-at-a-popular-vpn/)

In addition to iOS, NordVPN runs on all the most popular platforms. Prices start from $3.59 per month on a two-year standard plan, with three months of free access thrown in. Yearly plans begin at $4.99/month. If you only want to try out NordVPN for a month, prices begin at $12.99/month. 

NordVPN has also recently begun offering additional cybersecurity options, such as identity theft and cyber extortion coverage, under Ultimate plans, which begin at $6.49/month. 

****NordVPN features:** **Apple App Store rating:** 4.7 | **Simultaneous connections:** 10 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, tvOS, routers | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries:** 111 | **Servers:** 6,000+ | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial:** Seven days, Android

## Surfshark VPN

### Best budget iPhone VPN

Surfshark VPN is an affordable and reliable service. We found no information leaks and fast connection times when we reviewed it. Luckily, the company doesn't skimp on security. It offers AES-256-GCM, RSA-2048, and Perfect Forward Secrecy encryption. 

Surfshark supports devices running iOS 14.0 or higher. The VPN has many features, including ad and tracker blocking, a data breach scanner, and multi-hop connections (connecting through two servers). This VPN is excellent for iPhone users because of its user-friendliness, uncomplicated and quick connection process, and reasonable price point.

That said, specific tools aren't available for iOS devices, as is the case for most VPN providers. If you want to use the Bypasser tool (Surfshark's [split tunneling](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-vpn-split-tunneling/) feature), you must use the Windows or Android app. 

During testing, we've enjoyed using Surfshark as a "one size fits all" VPN solution. Sometimes, the speeds aren't the best while streaming, but connecting is quick. We also appreciate the "pause" function, which allows you to resume your normal connection for five minutes, 30 minutes, or a few hours. Customers say that speeds are relatively fast and streaming works the majority of the time, although some have experienced issues with Netflix and other popular content services.

**Review:** [**Surfshark VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

You can pay $15.45 for a month of access, $2.99 per month on a one-year plan, or only $2.19 if you are happy to remain a subscriber for at least two years. The VPN provider has also thrown in three months of free access on 12-month and 24-month plans.

****Surfshark VPN features:** **Apple App Store rating:** 4.8 | **Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, routers | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries:** 100+, 3,200 servers | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: Seven days on Android, iOS, and MacOS

## ExpressVPN

### Best iPhone VPN for server range and usability

The ExpressVPN app supports iOS back to iOS 15.0\. So, as long as your iPhone runs on iOS 15 or higher, you can use ExpressVPN. In addition to iOS, it supports all major platforms. There are browser extensions for Edge, [Chrome](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-chrome-vpn/), and Firefox, and a [VPN service for gaming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-gaming-vpn/) is also available.

If you want the most options for countries to connect to, ExpressVPN has servers located in 105 countries. ExpressVPN ranks among the fastest VPNs, so it shouldn't reduce your connection speeds as much as the average VPN. 

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

ExpressVPN doesn't maintain browsing history logs, but it does keep track of some information, such as the dates you connect and the location of the VPN server you connect to. The details of what is and isn't logged are [stated in ExpressVPN's privacy policy](https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-vpn/policy-towards-logs).

We've used ExpressVPN for years and found it to be a speedy, reliable service with a great server network. Many customer reviews are positive, but the pricing model and renewal hikes aren't popular.

Overall, if you're looking for a set-and-forget VPN with decent speeds and user-friendliness, ExpressVPN is a top pick. Each plan is limited to eight simultaneous devices.

Other subscription offers are $9.99 monthly for six months or $12.95 for one month of access. Alternatively, signing up for a 12-month plan is $6.67/month, with three months of free access and a year of Backblaze cloud backup. The iPhone app comes with a 7-day free trial.

**ExpressVPN features:** **Apple App Store rating:** 4.7 | **Simultaneous connections:** 8 | **Kill switch**: Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, tvOS, routers | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Countries:** 105 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: Seven days, Android and iOS

### Best configurable VPN for iPhone

IPVanish has depth and plenty of configuration settings for those who want to control almost every aspect of their VPN connection.

While it's not the most stylish VPN with the best interface, IPVanish VPN has many protocols, so you'll always know what to expect regardless of what you're connecting to. The app has an abundance of configuration options, and there's an extensive range of server selection options. The service is also independently security-audited. 

**Review:** [**IPVanish VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipvanish-review-a-rich-wealth-of-options-and-surfing-controls/)

We found IPVanish to be impressively fast and quick to connect. However, it couldn't hide that we connected through a VPN, which could be an issue in countries where internet connectivity and activities are monitored at the state or ISP level. That said, IPVanish's data transfers were secure and provided a good user experience. Customers report they are happy with IPVanish's customer service and the overall speed and reliability of the VPN. 

IPVanish is an excellent option for iOS and [Mac devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac-vpn/). You can sign up for a two-year plan for $2.19 per month or a yearly subscription for $3.33/month. Alternatively, if you don't want to sign up for the long haul, you can pay $12.99 for a month of access. IPVanish supports devices back to iOS 14\. 

****IPVanish VPN features:** **Apple App Store rating:** 4.5 | **Simultaneous connections:** Unlimited | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, tvOS, Kodi, routers | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Servers:** 2,200+ | **Locations:** 75 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: Seven days on Android and iOS

Pros 
* No data cap

Cons

## Proton VPN

### Best free VPN for iPhone

In general, we recommend you avoid [free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/). A free VPN service could even make money selling your data, which defeats the purpose of using a VPN to protect your identity, activities, and other information.

**Review:** [**Proton VPN**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/proton-vpn-review/)

The only situation where using a free VPN wouldn't necessarily come with security concerns is when it's a free version of a reputable paid service, as with Proton VPN. While limited to servers in five countries, you know the plan is supported by paid subscribers, and your data is safe. You won't be bombarded with adverts, either.

Despite poor Trustpilot reviews, many users report a positive experience with this VPN provider, noting its ease of use, low CAPTCHA block rates on websites, and stable connectivity. 

If you are interested in adopting the paid version of Proton VPN, you can sign up for a 24-month VPN plan at $4.49/month, a 12-month subscription at $4.99, or a one-month agreement at $9.99\. Note that Proton VPN requires iOS 15.0 or later.

ProtonVPN is a Swiss company, but you can make payments in US dollars.

**Proton VPN iOS features:** **Apple App Store rating:** 4.6 | **Simultaneous connections:** 1 (free) Up to 10 (paid) | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, Kodi, routers | **Logging:** No-logs policy | **Customer service:** FAQ, email | **Data limit:** None | **Free countries**: 5 | **Free servers:** 100+ | **Paid plans**: 4,000+ servers in 100 countries | **Trial**: Free plan

### Why do I need an iPhone VPN?

Our mobile devices are the keys to many aspects of our lives. Communication, payments, accessing local government services, and even as a way to entertain ourselves with content and games: our iPhones must be protected, and with it, our data. 

A VPN encrypts your online traffic and protects your information. If you must use a public Wi-Fi hotspot or an unknown Wi-Fi connection, a VPN can help shield you from eavesdropping and other cyberthreats. Security aside, you may also want to use a VPN to access streaming services and geolocked content while you're on the road.

### Can I trust iPhone VPN services?

As long as you choose a reputable VPN provider that provides a compatible iOS app, it will be safe to use. Steer clear of free VPN services with little to no customer feedback, as they may be malicious or only available in return for your data.

## Which is the right iPhone VPN for you?

| **Choose this VPN for iPhone...** | **If you want...**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NordVPN                           | The best iPhone VPN overall. NordVPN is a solid, feature-rich VPN. NordVPN's speeds and server network are impressive, but the price point for this reliable, secure VPN on shorter plans might be offputting for some.                                                         |
| Surfshark VPN                     | A top VPN that can just about do it all, and for an affordable price. Surfshark performs well in speed tests, earned solid customer reviews, and has an easy-to-use iOS mobile interface.                                                                                       |
| ExpressVPN                        | A stable and speedy choice for iOS. We've found that ExpressVPN connections are reliable almost all of the time. The mobile version of the VPN is simple, user-friendly, and comes packed with different server options. You can also take advantage of a 7-day free iOS trial. |
| IPVanish VPN                      | A highly flexible VPN. IPVanish offers a range of security and connectivity settings for you to choose from, although if you want to take full advantage of different protocols, you will want some technical knowledge.                                                        |
| Proton VPN                        | A free VPN. This Swiss VPN provider takes security seriously, and while the free version is restricted, it is still an excellent choice -- but the paid option removes all limits.                                                                                              |

## Factors to consider when choosing a VPN for iPhone

When you are selecting your new iPhone VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Cost**: You need to consider the overall cost of your new Apple-ready VPN. Try to take advantage of promotions, but ignore countdown timers -- they typically are just marketing tools. While top-notch VPNs can cost upwards of $10/month, many are available for only a few dollars.
* **Simultaneous connections**: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your iPhone or iPad, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or laptop. We recommend you sign up for a plan with support for at least four to six devices, although preferably one with unlimited simultaneous connections.
* **Contract length**: You must also decide how long you want a VPN. A two-year term tends to secure the best prices, but monthly, six-month, and one-year options are available. After you've made a selection, you typically have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
* **Apps**: When selecting an iPhone or iPad VPN, you must try it out first to ensure you like its accompanying iOS app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but need further development of their mobile apps, which may not be as intuitive or easy to use.
* **Compatibility**: iOS 18, released on September 16, 2024, is the latest version of the iPhone operating system. Many VPN provides will provide compatible apps going back generations, but if you have an older device, check before signing up.
* **Trials**: Many VPN providers will give users a free seven-day iOS trial, so consider trying a few out before you commit to a purchase.

## How we test VPNs

Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been talking about other VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

ZDNET does test VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, every community, every local ISP, and every nation has a different infrastructure. It's essential that once you choose, you test for all your likely usage profiles and only then make the decision to keep the service or request a money-back guaranteed refund, which all these VPNs have. 

If you experience traffic slowdowns, check your VPN and the Wi-Fi connection between your device and your router or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops.

We analyzed the best VPNs for iPhone below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags, making it intolerable.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you'd need a service that allows at least five simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN to have, as it protects by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geoblocks and streaming**: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well in these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our iPhone VPN recommendations, naturally, have to run easy-to-use and intuitive mobile apps.
* **Countries & servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length & price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee.

## FAQs on VPNs for iPhone

### Does a VPN slow down your iPhone?

A VPN shouldn't be very resource-intensive, and so should not slow down your iPhone. However, you may notice a slowdown in internet speeds as your requests go through your VPN's server network. Depending on the strength and base speed of your internet connection, streaming and gaming may be impacted.

### Do new iOS devices come with a pre-built VPN?

Apple iPhones do not have an inbuilt VPN, although you can install one using a mobile device management (MDM) solution. However, iOS does support VPN usage and many VPN providers have developed iOS-native mobile applications. 

### Will my VPN work with the latest version of iOS?

The latest version of iOS is [iOS 18](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100), released on 16 September. It is likely that your VPN will remain compatible as vendors will update their software as necessary. However, if you have an older iPhone, you may find that legacy iOS versions -- such as iOS 14 -- are phased out over time. Many VPN apps are now only compatible with iOS 15.0 and above.

### How do I set up a VPN on my iPhone?

Setting up a VPN on your iPhone is fairly simple. You need to download one of the apps on our list in the Apple App Store. Once you've created a login and started your subscription, you are ready to connect securely.

Ensure you do not download any apps from untrusted sources. Mobile device management (MDM) solutions utilizing VPNs can be configured in [iOS settings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/deployment/dep2d2adb35d/web).

### Do I need a VPN if I just use my carrier's data?

Perhaps. That depends on how much you trust your carrier. You're better off encrypting your data when it's in motion, whether you use Wi-Fi or a carrier connection. Overall, it's still recommended to use a VPN no matter the type of internet access you have in use.

### Isn't iCloud+ Private Relay a VPN? Why do I need another VPN?

Apple [iCloud+ Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614) is a feature of iCloud+. If you buy any iCloud storage, you'll get the iCloud+ features. But while Private Relay can hide your email address and location, it only does it when you're using Safari. If you're using Chrome (or any applications that use the Internet directly), you're out of luck. The service is also not available in all countries.

It also shows up as a proxy server. You also can't change or hide your location, as you can with a full VPN. Private Relay is a feature of iCloud+. A VPN is a full security solution.

### Are there any free iPhone VPNs?

There are many free VPNs available for mobile devices, including those in Apple's ecosystem. However, nothing in life is truly free, and you will likely be handing over your data in return for the service. They may also not be trustworthy, may be ad-supported, and may track your online activities. 

Those that are free but from trustworthy companies are few and far between. ProtonVPN's free VPN is an option we support, although it is extremely limited.
