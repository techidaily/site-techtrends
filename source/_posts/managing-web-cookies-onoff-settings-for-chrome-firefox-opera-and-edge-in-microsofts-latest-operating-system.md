## To make your Windows 10 device faster

 The following are a few methods that have helped many Windows 10 users speed up their device. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. [**Disable your startup items**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Configure your power plan**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

6. [**Run Disk Cleanup**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [**Check for virus and malware**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Restart your device

 The simplest fix you can try is to restart your Windows 10 device. This can free up the memory your operating system is occupying, end the processes that are using system resources, and get rid of all temporary issues that corrupt your operating system. This method is especially helpful when your Windows 10 system has been running for a long time.

 Try restarting your Windows 10 device, then check to see if it runs faster. If it does, great. But if not, there are several more fixes for you to try…

### Method 2: Disable your startup items

 Startup items mean the programs or processes that run automatically when your operating system starts. They can affect your Windows 10 system performance. You should check these items and disable the ones you don’t need.

 This will only stop those items from running automatically at startup. You can still open these programs or services.

To do so:

**1)** Right click any empty space of the taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b2a1b3f9adc9.jpg)

**2)** Click the**Startup** tab, then disable the items you don’t need.

 If you’re not sure what an item is, do some research on the Internet to know what it is and if you can disable it.

 To disable a startup item, right click this item and click**Disable** .

**3)** Restart your device and see if this restores your system performance.

### Method 3: Configure your power plan

 Your Windows 10 device may be running slow because you’re using a energy saving power plan. To make your device run faster, you should check your power settings and change your power plan. Here’s how to do it.

**1)** Right click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of your screen, then click**Power Options** .

**2)** Click**Additional power settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b2a281e65a10.jpg)

**3)** Make sure the_Power saver_ plan is NOT chosen.

 You can choose the**High performance** plan for better performance. But if you want a longer battery life, it’s recommended that you choose the**Balanced** plan.

**4)** Check to see if this speeds up your Windows 10 system.

**6)** Wait for Disk Cleanup to clean the files.

### Method 7: Check for virus or malware

 Virus or malware can slow down your Windows 10 system. They take up a lot of system resources and decrease your system performance. To see if that’s the case for you, you should check your computer for virus or malware. Run Windows Defender or the antivirus solution you’re using. If it finds any suspicious file or program, remove it and see if this restores your device performance.
