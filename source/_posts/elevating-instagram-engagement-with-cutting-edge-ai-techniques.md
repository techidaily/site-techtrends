##  Where to Find Meta AI on Instagram 

 The Meta AI tool is free for all Instagram users within the iOS and Android apps. While you can use some of its functionality when creating an Instagram Story, the main Meta AI tool is in the messaging section.  

1. Open the Instagram app on your device and tap the**Messages** icon to open your inbox.
2. Tap the circular**Meta AI** icon in the search bar to start a chat with Meta AI. Alternatively, you can also start a chat with the tool by typing directly in the search bar.  
 If you don’t see the**Meta AI** icon, you may need to update your Instagram app.
3. Type a request or message as you usually would when chatting with someone else on Instagram. You can also select any of the sample prompts that will appear within the chat the first time you use Meta AI.

4. For more prompt examples, select the hamburger menu icon, which looks like three horizontal lines. This menu has a massive list of prewritten phrases that you can tap.  
 Like similar AI tools, you can ask Meta AI direct questions such as “**What can you do?** ” or “**How can I use you?** ” whenever you feel lost.
5. To access Meta AI in a regular chat with other Instagram users, mention**@MetaAI** within the chat, followed by your prompt.

##  How to Create Images With Meta AI in Instagram 

 Meta AI features built-in Emu functionality, which lets you create AI images and animations directly within Instagram messages for free. Here’s how to use Meta AI to make images in Instagram:  

1. To create an AI image, type “**/imagine** ” followed by a description of the image you want to make within the same message. For this example, we’ll use “**a dragon drinking coffee** ”.  
 In your description, you can add as many details as you like such as verbs, adjectives, and even art styles.
2. Don’t worry about forgetting the correct prompt language; you can also use casual language to create images with Meta AI in Instagram. In this case, our casual-language prompt is, "**Create an image of a fairy drinking coffee** ."  
 You don’t use to use “**/imagine** ” when using the casual “**Create an image of…** ” request.

3. To make changes to an image, tell Meta AI what adjustments you’d like to see in the chat. Here we’ll say, “**Change the time of day to night** ”.  
 You don’t need to start from scratch when making changes to an image. Type your change requests immediately after the image in the chat, or long-press the image, select**Reply** , and type your request if the image isn’t the latest addition to the conversation.

4. You can also ask Meta AI to dramatically change the vibe of an image with some basic prompts. For example, we can use “**Make the fairy scary** ” to change the image from a cute fairy image to a more horrific one suitable for a Halloween event.
5. Something very cool that Meta AI can do is turn your AI image into a 3D model to create a short animation. To do this to any image that you’ve created, long-press the image, tap**Reply** , and type “**animate** ”.  
 You can also save your AI image from this same long-press menu.

##  How to Create Meta AI Instagram Stickers 

 One of Meta AI’s most lauded features is its ability to generate custom stickers. Unlike the rest of Meta AI’s functionality, which is located within Messages, the AI sticker creation tool is in the Instagram Stories menus.

 Trying to create AI stickers in a chat conversation with Meta AI will simply pull text from websites via Bing about how to make stickers.

 Here’s how to make AI stickers in Instagram with Meta AI.  

1. Start to[ make an Instagram Story](https://www.lifewire.com/post-a-story-on-instagram-5069910) as usual and select the**Stickers** icon.  
AI stickers work in both photo and text Instagram Stories.
2. Tap**AI Stickers** .
3. Enter a brief description of the stickers you want to create. For this example, we’ll write “**rainbow fairy** ”.

4. Tap**Generate** .
5. Scroll through the generated stickers and select the one you like.
6. Drag and resize your new AI sticker on your Instagram Story as you would with any other sticker.

7. Repeat with as many AI stickers as you like, and then publish your Story when ready.  
 Created AI stickers aren’t saved, so you’ll need to create new ones each time you want to use them.

##  What Can Instagram’s Meta AI Do? 

 Meta AI is similar to other AI chatbots in that you can ask it questions and use it to pull information from search engines and websites. Here are some examples of things you can ask Meta AI in Instagram.

* “How’s the weather today in New York?”
* “What’s a good dish to cook for a trendy Christmas dinner?”
* “Tell me a joke.”
* “Show me some posts about male fashion.”
* “Show me some Reels about anime.”
* “What are the most popular tourist destinations in Japan?”

 Remember that Meta AI is designed to sound like a real person, so if you're ever unsure of what to say, try speaking to it as if you were having a real conversation with someone. Ask it for some ideas or inspiration. You can even ask it how it's feeling today.  

 As with all chatbots, confirm what it says for factuality, and never give it sensitive information.
