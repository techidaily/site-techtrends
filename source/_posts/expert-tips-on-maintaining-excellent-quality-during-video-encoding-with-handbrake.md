## Part 1\. How to Compress Video in Handbrake without Losing Quality?

To make video size smaller, firstly you need to know the video compression is achieved by removing certain data from the video sequence. There are mainly two types of compression: remove unnecessary redundant data or remove insignificant/less important data. 

The first type can exceedingly compress and reduce video size with virtually no quality loss while the second one would dramatically shrink file size at the expense of certain quality loss. And to let Handbrake compress video without losing quality, you're highly advised to use the 1st method: remove unnecessary redundant data. To make this happen, the video codec is the key instead of the Handbrake settings (bit rate, frame rate, resolution, etc.). 

As we have mentioned above, video compression codec is the key to reduce video size. large-sized 1080p/4K/8K UHD video without quality loss. Yet, which video codec is the best for you to compress 1080p HD or 4K/8K UHD videos while keeping the original quality? The answer is HEVC (H265) that has much higher compression ratio than H.264, but it is not that compatible with diverse devices. So, choose H.265 or H.264 coding format based on your needs.

Preparations: The Handbrake compress video guide will request a computer, a video file, and the HandBrake itself. And at the very begining, you need get the open-source HandBrake video compressor from its official site.

**Step 1: Download and install HandBrake** 

It is always recommended to go to _http://handbrake.fr_, the official Handbrake site to download this video compressor so as to avoid any malware or adware installation. 

**Step 2: Add the video you want to reduce file size**

 Click "File" in the "Source Selection" to add a video file to be compressed in HandBrake after it is kicked off. Here in the guide, we'd like to [compress a 4k video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) in MKV that weighs in at over 24GB, around 60 minutes long, to MP4 H.264 for smaller size to give you an example. 

![Add Video to HandBrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hb-1.jpg) 

**Step 3: Set Destination Folder to save the compressed video**

Click "Browse" button under "Destination" where you can save the compressed file in your local hard drive. 

**Step 4: Choose an output format**

Choose the container MP4 in the "Output Settings". This is because MP4 has the widest compatibility with devices, players, TVs, gaming systems, and even the video sharing sites like YouTube, Facebook, etc. 

![Choose MP4 H264](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hb-2.jpg) 

Generally, the default preset in Handbrake is "Fast 1080p30". If this is not what you need, tap the option icon to open the hidden preset list. It covers Very Fast 1080p 30 -480p30, Fast series, and HQ/Super HQ 1080p30 Surround. Certainly, your primary goal is to reduce video size. Thus, you're not advised to choose HQ or Super HQ presets unless quality does matter a lot. 

Drop down the list and there are also preset profiles for web, devices (Apple, Android, PS, Roku, Amazon Fire...), Matroska, Hardware, etc. Pick up the one you need. Meanwhile, you're allowed to import your own made preset into Handbrake for latter video compression. You can simply use the presets to compress video with Handbrake for the web.

![Choose Preset profile for your video](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hb-3.jpg) 

**Step 5: Adjust HandBrake compression settings** 

The video file size is mainly decided by coding format, resolution and bit rate, so below words will teach you how to set them in perfect condition so as to make your video balanced in size and quality.

**1\. Choose H.264 video codec:** HEVC is famous for its great compression ratio that delivers half of the bandwidth data and compresses video at a file size half off the original without sacrificing the quality as compared with its predecessor H.264\. 

But it is currently not as widely used as H.264 now. So we recommend you to stay with H.264 in terms of both file size and compatibility. But users of iPhone 6 or above, we highly recommend you to choose H.265 in HandBrake to shrink video file size, since iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra (or later) are reported to support H.265 compression. 

![HandBrake Best Compression Settings](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/handbrake-video-compress-setting.png) 

**2\. Video resolution is set to 1080p or 720p:** Video resolution has great impact on the file size. However, higher resolution doesn't necessarily mean you will have a better visual enjoyment on a screen with a lower resolution. For example, a 4K video won't look better than a 1080p HD video on a HD TV. So it's advisable to compress 4K to a video, preferably 720p 30fps or 1080p 30fps for YouTube or Facebook. 

![Adjust video resolution](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hb-4.jpg) 

**3\. Enter an Average Bitrate (kbps) between 5,000-10,000:** More bitrate means more artifacts and better video quality and vice versa. So when you compress video with Handbrake, you can also lower the bitrate corresponding to the resolution. Generally, it's recommended to set the bitrate at around 2500 kbps for a video with a resolution of 480p, 5000 kbps for 720p, 8000 kbps for 1080p, 35000kbps for 2160p. 

![Change video bit rate](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/../mac-video-converter-pro/article-image/hb-5.jpg) 

By following the above steps, you can customize your video file size at will. To reduce file size with HandBrake more easily and quickly, you can also follow the below ideas about HandBrake best compression settings.

## Part 2\. HandBrake Best Compression Settings to Compress Videos

* 4K 2160p: 35-45Mbps for standard frame rate (24, 25, 30); 53-68Mbps for high frame rate (48, 50, 60).
* 2K 1440p: 16Mbps for standard frame rate; 24Mbps for high frame rate.
* 1080p HD: 8Mbps for standard frame rate; 12Mbps for high frame rate.
* 720p: 5Mbps for standard frame rate; 7.5Mbps for high frame rate.
* 480p: 2.5Mbps for standard frame rate; 4Mbps for high frame rate.

**High Dynamic Range:** 

* 4K 2160p: 44-56Mbps for standard frame rate (24, 25, 30); 66-85Mbps for high frame rate (48, 50, 60).
* 2K 1440p: 20Mbps for standard frame rate; 30Mbps for high frame rate.
* 1080p HD: 10Mbps for standard frame rate; 15Mbps for high frame rate.

## Part 3\. FAQs about How to Compress Video with Handbrake

**1\. How do I reduce the size of a video in Handbrake?**

Launch Handbrake and click "Open Source" to select your video file. Choose an output location and format. In the "Video" tab, adjust the "Quality" slider to reduce video quality. Lower values result in smaller files. In the "Picture" tab, adjust the "Width" or "Height" to reduce resolution, thereby decreasing size. Lower the "Average Bitrate" in the "Video" tab. This reduces the data used for encoding, further shrinking the file. Click "Start" to initiate the conversion.

**2\. Does Handbrake degrade video quality?**

Yes, Handbrake can potentially degrade video quality if you're not careful with the settings you choose. When you reduce the size of a video using compression software like Handbrake, you're essentially reducing the amount of data in the video file. This reduction in data can lead to a loss of detail, clarity, and color accuracy, resulting in a degraded video quality.

**3\. What is the maximum video size for Handbrake?**

Handbrake does not impose a strict maximum video size limit, as it primarily focuses on compression and conversion. However, the actual practical limit depends on factors like your system's resources, the codec used, and the intended playback device's compatibility. Generally, Handbrake is used to reduce video file sizes while maintaining reasonable quality. For example, converting a large 4K video to a smaller 1080p version can significantly decrease the file size.

**4\. Why is Handbrake making my files bigger?**

Handbrake might enlarge files if settings are incorrect. Lower bitrate in "Video" tab to reduce size. Choose efficient codecs like H.264 or H.265\. Stick to original or lower resolution, and avoid upscaling. Use "Average Bitrate" mode to set a target size instead of "Constant Quality" mode. Adjust audio settings and remove unnecessary subtitles. Consider single-pass encoding instead of multiple passes.
