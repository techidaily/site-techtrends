Today at Apple Park, the tech giant Apple announced a new generation of AirPods at its annual hardware event. The AirPods 4 are available at two price points, depending on whether you want noise cancellation. They feature a USB-C port, audio features like personalized spatial audio, and a Find My speaker, so you don't lose them.

Apple's previous-generation AirPods, launched last year, did not sell as well as expected. In response, the company launched two options for the AirPods 4\. While both have virtually the same features, the price tag adds $50 for the model with active noise cancellation. 

Both options now have a smaller, more portable case and a built-in speaker for Find My tracking. They also boast 30 hours of battery life, hopefully fixing the battery problems that users have been reporting. The new AirPods also allow you to shake your head 'yes' or 'no' to Siri requests and have Apple's H2 chip, which creates crisper audio.

The Find My speaker is a convenient way to locate your AirPods when you know they're nearby but can't pinpoint their exact location. The feature on the new AirPods functions similarly to that on the more premium AirPods Pro, you should be able to trigger the speaker built into the case by clicking the "Play Sound" button in the Find My app.

It will then alert a sound to help you locate your device. This feature, once reserved for the [AirPods Pro 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-airpods-pro-2-can-soon-double-as-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-heres-how/), will be one of many new features funneling into Apple's more accessible earbuds. The USB-C port will help make Apple charging universal, but the case will also be able to be wirelessly charged.

The AirPods 4 will be available for preorder today and on sale at the Apple store and other retailers on September 20.
