## Find Your Perfect Wallpaper in the Spectacular Visuals of the James Webb Space Observatory

NASA launched the James Webb Space Telescope in December 2021, giving scientists a fresh look at the universe and giving the rest of us some cool wallpapers. Thankfully, there's an easy way to check out the latest images and save them for your device's wallpaper.

 Processed images from the James Web Space Telescope have been published on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NASAWebb), the [telescope's official website](https://webbtelescope.org/home), and other locations, but there's another portal you may not have seen. NASA operates [a Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/albums) for the telescope, which contains images of engineering tests, control centers, and best of all, space pictures.

 You can browse through the whole collection in your browser, and saving the full-resolution version of an image is as easy as clicking the download button (the arrow pointing down). If you have a Flickr account, you can also follow the account to see new pictures. Flickr provides [an RSS feed](https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos%5Fpublic.gne?id=50785054@N03&lang=en-us&format=rss%5F200) as well that you can subscribe to with [your RSS app of choice](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfecting-pace-techniques-for-shooting-captivating-slow-motion-content-for-instagram-audiences/), like Feedly or Inoreader.

 The first few photos from the James Webb Space Telescope [were already excellent wallpapers](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-tuxera-nero-reader-comprehensive-multimedia-tool/), but the Flickr gallery is being updated with the latest images. There's [a composite of the Pillars of Creation](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52534406448/in/photostream), [two galaxies merging](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52533787586/in/photostream), [Jupiter in infrared](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52303461859/in/album-72177720301006030/), and [a fiery hourglass](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/52504158265/in/dateposted/).

 If the 32-year run (and counting) of the Hubble Space Telescope is any indication, the James Webb telescope should continue giving us fantastic images for years to come.
