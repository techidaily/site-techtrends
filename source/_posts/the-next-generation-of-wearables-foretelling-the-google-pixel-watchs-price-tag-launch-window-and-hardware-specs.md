 Following two other Pixel-branded smartwatches, Google seems prepared to give their wearable an annual update. Nothing is official yet, but there's a good chance the Pixel Watch 3 will arrive in late 2024 and come in two sizes instead of just one. A bigger size could mean a bigger screen and longer battery life.

## When Will the Pixel Watch 3 Be Released?

 Based on how Google released the first two Pixel watches, we can expect the Pixel Watch 3 release date to coincide with the[Pixel 9](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-9-8630767) launch. It will likely be revealed at[the next Made by Google event](https://www.lifewire.com/google-event-5205756) on August 13.

## Google Pixel Watch 3 Price Rumors

 The first two Pixel Watches started at $349.99\. This is likely how Google will price its next smartwatch. And, of course, you can expect to pay around $50 more for LTE.

 So this year's only cost difference will be if there's an additional size. It's fair to expect a bigger watch to cost more. Using Samsung as an example, $30 is tacked on to the bill for a 4 mm size increase. We can only hope Google doesn't exceed that.

 To that end, we might be looking at these prices:

* **Pixel Watch 3 (41 mm)** : $349.99
* **Pixel Watch 3 (41 mm / LTE)** : $399.99
* **Pixel Watch 3 XL (45 mm)** : $379.99
* **Pixel Watch 3 XL (45 mm / LTE)** : $429.99

## Pre-Order Information

 You'll be able to pre-order the Pixel Watch 3 from the[Google Store](https://store.google.com/category/watches) . We'll drop the link here when pre-ordering starts.

## Google Pixel Watch 3 Specs & Features

 The battery life in the[Pixel Watch 2](https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-watch-2-7498464) received a bump over the first edition. This update was much needed, but it can still be improved. For example,[Samsung's Galaxy Watch 6](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-news-and-rumors-7371704) lasts around 30 hours with Always-on Display enabled, while Google claims the Pixel Watch 2 can sustain 24 hours of use.

 To maximize long-term usage, we're crossing our fingers for a larger battery in the Pixel Watch 3, especially if[rumors of a bigger watch](https://9to5google.com/2024/01/19/source-pixel-watch-3/) turn out to be true. According to sources from_9to5Google_ , it seems that Google is indeed working on two different sizes for the Pixel Watch 3\. Adding weight to this story, 91Mobiles found a purported listing of the Pixel Watch 3 battery, indicating a[slight increase in capacity](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-3-spotted-dekra-safety-korea-sites-battery-revealed/) compared to its predecessor.

 A bigger watch also means the screen can be enlarged, making[Wear OS apps](https://www.lifewire.com/best-wear-os-apps-7510805) easier to use. This is another problem many people have had with both existing watches; they're just too small. At one size option, these watches simply don't work well with the variety of wrist sizes we all have.

 A bigger size would level up the Pixel Watch 3 to the point that it'd be a strong contender among watches from other companies. The Galaxy Watch 6, for example, has a 47 mm option, while the Pixel Watch has been stuck at 41 mm for the last two years. And that's without mentioning the behemoth[Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-ultra-2-7556473) with its 49 mm case. It's doubtful Google will match Apple's offering, so in addition to the 41 mm size, we're hoping to see a second model at least_approach_ the competition, so maybe a 45 mm option.

 Fortunately, that's exactly what we're seeing from the leaks. While the base model will probably have[the same 1.2-inch display as the Pixel Watch 2](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-watch-3-first-look-renders-exclusive/) , a potential Pixel Watch 3 XL expands the screen to 1.45 inches. Both sizes are rumored to come with a slightly smaller bezel, reducing it from 5.5mm to 4.5mm, and a brighter display.

 This watch might also support UWB for finding lost devices and unlocking your car via Digital Car Key. This was once reported by some to arrive with the Pixel Watch 2, but[FCC listings confirm the feature is actually coming this year](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-3-fcc-3458102/) .

 According to a patent filing called[Gesture Recognition on Watch Bezel Using Strain Gauges](https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11775167) , Google could even do away with all buttons on their smartwatch. If this technology makes its way into the Pixel Watch 3, you might be able to trigger specific actions or open apps using a gesture, like a tap, swipe, or squeeze on the side of the watch. The patent supports this not only for user-friendly reasons but also for aesthetic purposes and to make waterproofing easier.

Google

 We don't yet know if Google will change how this watch charges... again. The first two watches use two different chargers. Our guess? The Pixel Watch 3 will ship with the same magnetic pin charger as the PW2.

 So what about bands? At around $50 a pop, Google's watch bands are another cost to consider, so hopefully, the Pixel Watch 3 will support existing bands. The XL model will likely not be compatible due to its size.

[Android Authority has all the color details](https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-3-changes-3458593/) . The smaller watch has four options: Silver case / Rose Quartz, Black case / Obsidian, Gold case / Hazel, and Silver case / Porcelain. The larger model will be offered in three colors: Hazel case / Hazel, Black case / Obsidian, and Silver case / Porcelain.

 We'll know more about the Pixel Watch 3 hardware as images leak (hopefully) and reports surface closer to the August event. There's also Wear OS 5 to watch on the software front.
