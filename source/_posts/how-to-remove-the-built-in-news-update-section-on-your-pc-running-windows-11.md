### Use the Registry 

 You'll need to perform a basic[ Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) tweak if Windows 11 isn't activated. That's because some personalization settings, including the one for removing the widget, aren't available unless Windows is activated. This is very easy to do even if you've never been in the registry.

1. Open Registry Editor by searching for it or executing the**regedit** command.
2. Using the folders/keys from the left panel, navigate to this location:  
 `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\`
3. Locate the**TaskbarDa** value from the right panel. If it's there, skip down to Step 5, otherwise, right-click**Advanced** from the left panel and go to**New** \>**DWORD (32-bit) Value** .  
![New DWORD 32-bit value menu in Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6wOCJAyPlV_1bRELfe7IHD8fdzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_disable-news-and-interests-taskbar-in-windows-11-5190865-0c30424c4a614a7d91326e1b6ecaf07e.jpg)
4. When you're asked to name the value, type this, followed by the Enter key:  
 `TaskbarDa`
5. Double-click**TaskbarDa** and assign it**0** to hide the widgets button, or**1** to make it visible.  
![taskbarda registry value](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EaiKCZum4ZBO1_yRyO67Z2x4y6Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_disable-news-and-interests-taskbar-in-windows-11-5190865-99d131ce5e004f5eb10d0f745eb3d569.jpg)
6. Select**OK** to apply the change instantly.

##  How to Open the Widgets Board Without the Taskbar Shortcut

 `Win+W`
