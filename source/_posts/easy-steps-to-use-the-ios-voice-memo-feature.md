## Easy Steps to Use the iOS Voice Memo Feature
### What to Know

* In the Messages app, tap and hold the**audio** icon while speaking. Release your finger and tap the**up arrow** .
* Open the Voice Memos app and tap**record** . When finished, tap**stop** . Tap the three dots icon and select **Share** .

 This article explains two easy ways to send voice messages on your iPhone. You can create and share an audio message using the Messages and Voice Memos apps. This option is convenient if speaking is quicker and easier than typing or if you want your recipient to hear your voice.

## Create and Send a Voice Message With Messages

 Typing text messages can be time-consuming if you have a lot to say. By sending a voice message in[the Messages app](https://www.lifewire.com/imessage-apples-free-texting-app-1999185) , you can say exactly what you want to your recipient.

 These instructions apply to iPhones running iOS 16 and later. We've noted any differences between versions.

1. Open the conversation you want to send a voice message in, or start a new one.

2. Select the**plus** sign to the left of the text field.  
 In iOS 16, tap the**Apps** icon below the text box.
3. Choose**Audio** from the menu. You may have to scroll down to find it.  
 In iOS 16, select the**Audio** icon, which looks like a waveform.

4. The message will automatically start recording, and the text box will have a red recording bar in it.  
 In iOS 16, you may need to choose the microphone icon to the right of the message field. Tap once to start recording, or tap and hold to send the message as soon as you release the button.
5. Record your message, and then select**Stop** to end the recording.
6. Tap**Send** to share the audio message. Alternatively, tap**Play** to preview it, and**X** to cancel.

### Drawbacks of Using Messages

 Here are a couple of disadvantages to using this function in Messages:

* As an iPhone user, you cannot currently send voice messages using the Messages app to other smartphones like Android.
* By default, audio messages expire two minutes after you listen to them and are automatically removed. Your recipient can tap**Keep** to hold onto your message or disable the expiration by going to**Settings** \>**Messages** .

 If your recipient isn’t an iPhone user or you want to avoid the possible expiration of your audio message, consider sharing your message using Voice Memos.

## Create and Send a Voice Message With Voice Memos

 The[Voice Memos app](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-voice-memos-on-iphone-4799058) is excellent for capturing audio notes, speakers during a meeting, and more. Since you can easily share a voice recording from the app, this is a solid alternative to the Messages app on iPhone.

1. Open Voice Memos on your iPhone and tap (don’t hold) the red **Record** button at the bottom.
2. Speak your message. You’ll see the duration of the recording as you speak.
3. When you finish with your message, tap the red **Stop** button.

4. The recording pops to the top section of the screen. You can tap the **Play** button to have a listen.  
 To share, tap the**three dots** next to the name of the recording.  

### Tip

 If you want to rename the recording before you share it, tap the current title and type in the new one.
5. Select **Share** .
6. Choose a sharing option from the Share Sheet. Depending on your iPhone's sharing options, you can send the audio message in a text message, email, or shared storage service like Dropbox.
