## What Causes a MacBook Air to Freeze?

 Many simple fixes can solve a frozen MacBook Air. It can be due to a malfunctioning program, an issue with macOS itself, or a hardware fault such as overheating or a RAM problem. Each of these issues has very different solutions.

 Fortunately, you can fix many of these issues at home, but there are certain cases where your MacBook Air needs to be professionally repaired by Apple or may even be beyond repair.

 Before reaching that stage, it's a good idea to narrow things down to the specific problem you're dealing with and try to troubleshoot the issue.

2. Try force quitting an app via the Apple menu. Click the Apple icon on your laptop and scroll down to Force Quit to close the app.
3. [Force quit the app via Activity Monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/use-activity-monitor-to-track-mac-memory-usage-2260880) . A more effective way of force quitting an app or errant process is using Activity Monitor if previous methods haven't worked in shutting down the app.
4. Restart your MacBook Air. If you can't force quit the app and your MacBook Air isn't responding, shut down the computer. You'll lose all unsaved work, but it can fix many freezing issues.
5. Unplug any peripherals attached to your MacBook Air. Sometimes, a peripheral can be causing an issue with your MacBook Air. Try unplugging it to see if it corrects the problem.
6. [Boot into Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-mac-safe-boot-option-2260843) . Try using your MacBook Air's Safe Boot mode to check your computer is working correctly and fix any potential ongoing issues.
7. [Free up disc space](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-space-on-your-mac-4165916) . All computers can slow down substantially if they're low on disc space. Try removing unnecessary apps and documents to speed up your MacBook Air and stop it from freezing.

9. [Repair permissions](https://www.lifewire.com/using-disk-utility-repair-hard-drives-2260079) . If you're using a MacBook Air running OS X Yosemite or earlier, you may need to repair permissions to ensure any application you have issues with runs correctly. Doing this isn't required since OS X El Capitan as macOS automatically fixes its file permissions, but for older MacBook Airs, it's worth trying.
10. [Reset your MacBook Air.](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-macbook-air-4184823) As a last chance solution, try resetting your MacBook Air by wiping all the information off its hard drive and starting afresh. If you're able to, make sure to have backups of all your important documents, so you don't lose anything valuable.
11. Contact Apple customer support. If you continue to have issues with your MacBook Air freezing, contact Apple customer support. If your laptop is still under warranty, you may be able to get it repaired for free. Failing that, Apple customer support can still advise you on any other repair options and assist you further.
