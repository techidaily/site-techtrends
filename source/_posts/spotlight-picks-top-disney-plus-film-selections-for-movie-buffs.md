## Explore Our Top Picks: The 15 Best Free Bootable Anti-Virus Solutions Available Online
 Below is a list of all the best free bootable antivirus programs I could get my hands on. If you don't know what these are, they're simply virus scanners that start from a disc or flash drive instead of from your computer's hard drive.  

 In general, using one of these programs requires that you take the[ISO image](https://www.lifewire.com/iso-file-2625923) provided and then, from a working computer,[burn it to a disc](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-burn-an-iso-image-file-to-a-dvd-2626156) or[burn it to a USB drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-burn-an-iso-file-to-a-usb-drive-2619270) . Next, you'll need to[boot from the disc](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-boot-from-a-cd-dvd-or-bd-disc-2626090) or[boot from the flash drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-boot-from-a-usb-device-2626091) on the infected PC. More details are available in our reviews and on most of the websites linked below.  

## Our Favorite Bootable AV Scanners

 What We Like

* Several exclusion settings to customize the scan
* Virus definition updates are supported directly from the disc
* Has a graphical UI instead of text
* Built-in to newer versions of Windows

 What We Don't Like

* Downloads as an EXE file instead of directly as an ISO

 Microsoft Defender Offline (formerly called_Windows_ Defender Offline) is a bootable virus scanner from Microsoft that sports a full user interface. It's built-in to Windows 11 and Windows 10 and you can download it for older Windows versions or those newer ones if the computer won't start.

 An important feature I appreciate is that its definitions (the rules for finding threats) can be updated directly from the disc, which lots of bootable virus checkers can't do. You can also view quarantined files and exclude files, folders, and extension types from scans.

 This program supports quick virus scans, full scans, and custom scans so that you can choose your own folders and drives to scan.

 Use the link below to download this tool or, if it's built-in to your version of Windows, find it in Settings. Here's where it's at in Windows 11:**Settings** \>**Privacy & security** \>**Windows Security** \>**Virus & threat protection** \>**Scan options** \>**Microsoft Defender Antivirus (offline scan)** .

[Download Microsoft Defender Offline](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-protect-my-pc-with-microsoft-defender-offline-9306d528-64bf-4668-5b80-ff533f183d6c)

 The version that's available from the download page can burn the software to a disc or[USB](https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039) device for you, so no image burning software is necessary.

## [Dr.Web LiveDisk](https://free.drweb.com/aid%5Fadmin/)

![Dr.Web LiveDisk](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dAPOQUf61eXVl99issQLso4bUCQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/drweb-livedisk-57c762f35f9b5829f4b019eb.png)

 What We Like

* Custom options not found in some of these other bootable AV programs
* Lets you define the types of files it should scan
* Checks for virus definition updates from within the software
* Runs from a disc or flash drive

 What We Don't Like

* The large setup file might take a while to download for some

 Dr.Web LiveDisk is a feature-filled free bootable virus scanner for Windows and Linux.

 There are plenty of configurable settings, like choosing the actions Dr.Web should take when finding infected, suspicious, or incurable files. Also, you can set what should happen if it detects specific issues like adware, dialers, jokes, hacktools, and riskware.

 The program lets you exclude directories from being scanned, set how large a file can be before it's excluded from a scan, and define the maximum duration it's allowed to spend scanning a single file.

 Again, like with Microsoft's tool listed above, I like that Dr.Web can check for virus definition updates directly from the program. This means you can reuse the software in the future and all you have to do is update it before you do a scan.

 I used this AV program from a USB device, but it also works from a disc. The ISO file is over 800 MB.

 What We Like

* Lets you scan specific folders, the whole drive, and other areas
* Scans for many types of malware

 What We Don't Like

[Our Review of Kaspersky Rescue Disk](https://www.lifewire.com/kaspersky-rescue-disk-review-2617884)

 Kaspersky has what's called a _Rescue Disk_ , which can scan for viruses, worms, Trojans, malicious tools, adware, dialers, and other malicious items. Kaspersky is a huge name in security software, so I'm glad they made this tool.

 You can pick between using the graphical mode (recommended) or the text-only mode. Your scan options include_Fileless objects, Startup objects,_  and_System drive_ . You can also scan boot sectors and specific folders.

 Kaspersky's rescue software can also browse through the file system to copy or delete files. The Firefox browser is built in, too, among many other tools.

 The only downfall I have found is that the file is rather large and might take some time to download.

## [Hiren's BootCD PE](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/)

![hiren's bootcd pe running eset online scanner](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ex1m-dAQFW2grnu98OKcliWumy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hirens-boot-cd-31ad354e866d40fba838620da90d62cd.png)

 What We Like

* Comes with four virus scanning tools
* Full user interface, much like a Windows PC
* Includes lots of other useful programs

 What We Don't Like

* Might be more than you're looking for
* Infrequent updates

 Hiren's BootCD PE includes a suite of fix-it tools that make it indispensable for those times when you can't boot into your computer. In addition to its virus scanners from four companies—ESET, McAfee, Kaspersky, and Malwarebytes—are hard drive recovery and backup tools, system info utilities, and network scanners.

 As shown in the screenshot, this bootable rescue suite lets you use your mouse and navigate through a desktop interface, much like you can in Windows. I find this far easier to use than the text-based programs listed below, plus it means it includes other Windows programs, like[Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840) .

 You can also browse your hard drive, so if you know where a pesky virus is located, and you'd rather delete it yourself, it's fairly easy to do so. This also means you can copy files off your computer if necessary (like for backup reasons).

 This is an ISO file. The download page lists all the programs included on it.

 What We Like

* Super easy to use
* Advanced settings if you want to use them
* Complete desktop environment

 What We Don't Like

* Large download

 ESET SysRescue is another bootable virus scanner that you can use for free from a CD, DVD, or USB device. It comes from the company[ESET](https://www.eset.com/) , which also sells security software for home users and businesses.

 This tool provides a full desktop environment, so if you're uncomfortable with text-only user interfaces, you should be okay with how this one works. There's a start menu, desktop items for other tools like[GParted](https://www.lifewire.com/gparted-review-2624945) , a file browser, and of course a shortcut to ESET SysRescue.

 The virus scanner itself is very easy to use and can be used quickly without any customizations. From the**On-demand scan** page, just choose the option you want to use:**Smart scan** to check only some areas for malware—specifically, common locations malware is found; or choose**Custom scan** to run an in-depth, full scan of any area of the drive, including the whole thing.

 However, you can change advanced settings if you want. Some scan settings include choosing which object types to scan—such as files, symbolic links, email files, archives, self-extracting archives, boot sectors, and others. You can also enable heuristics, detect PuPs, exclude specific file extensions, and set scan limits on files of a certain size.

 A handy side feature I found when first running the program, is the option to check for errors on the disc or in the memory. You might find that something else is awry, and it's not really a virus; it could be worth a check!

## [Comodo Rescue Disk](https://help.comodo.com/topic-170-1-493-5214-Downloading-Comodo-Rescue-Disk.html)

![Comodo Rescue Disk](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Y0OlvcpEiA5zlbMZ73gOZIpRfbc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/comodo-rescue-disk-56a6fa073df78cf772913bd9.png)

​

 What We Like

* You can scan specific files/folders or the whole drive
* Includes an option to skip scanning certain files
* Supports multiple scan types based on what you want to scan
* Lets you pick between a graphical UI and one that's text only
* Checks for updates automatically
* Relatively small download size

 What We Don't Like

* It's difficult to use the file/folder-level scan option
* The program itself hasn't been updated in a long time

 In addition to the regular,[installable Comodo Antivirus software](https://www.lifewire.com/comodo-antivirus-review-1356601) , Comodo also has a free _bootable_ antivirus program.

 Comodo Rescue Disk works as a USB virus scanner or you can run it from a disc. It's available in text-only mode or with a full graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI version has a familiar program interface which is much easier to use.

 There are three scan types. If you don't want to run a full system scan, the smart scan checks for viruses and rootkits in the memory, boot sectors, autorun entries, and other areas like the registry and system folder. A custom scan lets you choose individual files and folders to scan instead of an entire drive.

 You can also scan archives, enable heuristics scanning, and skip files over a specified size.

 It's a plus that Comodo Rescue Disk includes a familiar Desktop-like interface because it makes it easier to use than some of these other text-based scanning tools.

## [Norton Bootable Recovery Tool](https://support.norton.com/sp/static/external/tools/nbrt.html)

![Norton Bootable Recovery Tool scanning computer for threats](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HpFkxcu0PJ8iS7koEQpCWRuuJZ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/norton-bootable-recovery-tool-f906a90e64ba4ff8b33063cf0da1454a.png)

 What We Like

* Boots to a fully interactive desktop
* Mostly automatic; known risks are deleted for you

 What We Don't Like

* Zero advanced options means you can't customize it
* It's unclear what it looks for
* Doesn't seem to stay current with virus definitions

 The makers of the popular Norton Antivirus software have this free bootable recovery tool available. It scans your computer for security risks and removes them automatically, or lets you decide what to do if it's a_potential_ risk.

 There's also a file retrieval option that helps you copy data from your computer to another drive, such as a removable hard drive. If you don't already have a method for doing that, and you're interested in some sort of file copy help, this might be a good choice for you.

 This is a full desktop experience, so you use your mouse to navigate. There's also a terminal window for running commands, and the Opera web browser if you need it.

 © Anvisoft Corporation

 What We Like

* Really easy to use
* Lets you scan the whole drive or certain folders only
* Can run a quick or full scan
* Able to repair malicious changes made to the registry
* Relatively small download size

 What We Don't Like

* Can't scan specific files only
* No longer gets updated

 Anvi Rescue Disk is a really simple bootable virus scanner. There are only three main scan buttons, two sections to the program, and no custom settings.

 You can run a quick smart scan, a full system scan, or a custom scan to search for malware inside one or more specific folders.

 There's also a section for finding and correcting corrupt[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) issues that may have been altered by a virus.

 One thing I don't like about Anvi Rescue Disk is that you must scan the whole drive at once—you can't choose to scan single, specific files like you can with regular antivirus software.

 I recommend any of the tools above this one first, but if you do choose this program, be aware that the software is not as up-to-date as the competition. It'll probably find_some_ viruses just fine, but it won't catch everything.

​

 What We Like

* Runs with a full desktop interface
* Lets you scan a whole drive or specific folders only
* Includes a tool to fix corrupt MBR problems
* Easier to use than some bootable AV programs

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks advanced scan settings found in similar programs
* Can't scan specific files only

 Zillya! LiveCD can scan entire drives or whole folders only, so it won't scan just single files. There's an option to check for viruses in potentially dangerous file types like executables so that you're not scanning every single file type, which could take a long time.

 A utility called _Zillya! MBR Recovery_  is available from this bootable disc, which can scan the[MBR](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-master-boot-record-mbr-2625936) for viruses and attempt to fix boot issues caused by a corrupt MBR.

 I appreciate all the settings that are included, as well as the fact that it provides a very easy-to-use interface. However, unlike the first several items in this list, Zillya!'s software is rather outdated and should not be your first choice.

 What We Like

* Scans things most bootable AV programs do not
* Lets you check for viruses on any attached hard drive
* Includes other tools like a hard drive tester

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't have a graphical interface like most programs, so it might be hard to use if you're not used to that
* Doesn't offer definition updates

 You've probably heard of[AVG](https://www.avg.com/) . This is their rescue CD, a text-only free bootable antivirus program. It can check for potentially unwanted programs, scan cookies, find hidden file extensions, and even scan inside archives.

 Before you start a scan, you have the option to just check a folder of your choice, just the[boot sector](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-boot-sector-2625815) , only the registry, or any locally attached hard drive.

 Unfortunately, because AVG Rescue CD doesn't provide a graphical interface, navigating the menus can become difficult.

[Download AVG Rescue CD](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/avg%5Frescue%5Fcd%5F%28for%5Fcd%5Fcreation%29.html)

 AVG no longer updates or maintains this program, so the virus definitions will forever be outdated. You can still scan your computer but it won't catch_brand-new_ threats.

 © Trend Micro Incorporated

 What We Like

* There are two scan types you can run
* Fairly easy to use considering the lack of advanced options

 What We Don't Like

* The user interface might be hard to use for some people
* Last updated in 2020

 Trend Micro Rescue Disk is another free bootable antivirus tool that doesn't have a graphical interface, meaning you'll need to navigate entirely in text mode with the arrow keys.

 You can run a quick scan or a full scan, depending on what areas you'd like checked.

 Trend Micro is a cybersecurity software company that's been around for a while, but this program hasn't been updated since 2020, which is one reason I've placed it so low on this list.

[Download Trend Micro Rescue Disk](https://downloadcenter.trendmicro.com/index.php?regs=nabu&prodid=1654)

 It's first downloaded as a regular program file that includes the bootable software. It works in Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. Just choose to install it on a USB device or CD.

 What We Like

* Updates automatically
* Can scan specific files, folders, and hard drives
* Small download size (under 200 MB)

 What We Don't Like

* Doesn't function as a true bootable AV program
* Doesn't work if the virus is blocking access to your computer
* Isn't as easy to use as similar tools

 Panda Rescue ISO uses[Panda Cloud Cleaner](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/homeusers/cloud-cleaner/) to scan a computer without any other running processes that could potentially shut it down and prevent a virus scan.

 After trying it out, this is what I discovered about how it works: First, you must boot to this disc to prepare your computer for running Panda Cloud Cleaner. Next, your computer will reboot into Windows but launch the cleaner before any other applications start. All other processes are shut down so that this program is less likely to be terminated by a virus.

 One problem with this tool is that it may not work properly if a virus has infected your computer so deeply that you can't even boot into Windows. If this is the case, you'll want to try any of the other tools in this list that _don't_ require Windows to start.

 What We Like

* Multiple scan types
* A cinch to use

 What We Don't Like

* The OS has to be Windows 7 or newer
* Only as specific as folders (i.e., you can't scan individual files only)
* No longer receives updates

 Adaware has this free bootable antivirus scanner that's a breeze to use. It has a full user interface just like desktop-based programs.

 There are multiple types of scans you can run, so whether it's a quick check for a boot sector virus or you want to find malware in specific folders or the whole computer, you can do it all with this program.

[Download Adaware Live CD](http://download.lavasoft.com/public/livecd/)

 On the download page, pick**amd64** for a 64-bit machine, or**x86** for 32-bit. See[How to Tell if You Have Windows 64-Bit or 32-Bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) to know which download to select.

 What We Like

* Easy to use because there aren't lots of options to get confused about
* Not as large of a download as some similar programs

 What We Don't Like

* Updates are no longer performed
* Doesn't have advanced scan options
* Missing the familiar graphical UI

 F-Secure Rescue CD is a simple bootable antivirus program. It works without any graphical user interface, so it might be a bit confusing.

 There are hardly any options or user input except pressing the_Enter_ key to confirm the start of a scan.

## [VBA32 Rescue](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Vba32-Rescue.shtml)

![VBA32 Rescue](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ItnbkWEv0bArFM9ZFOb6cCNEesg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/vba32-rescue-5980d09e68e1a20011c32d02.png)

 What We Like

* Has lots of scan options you can tweak

 What We Don't Like

* Might be hard to use because of the text-only interface

 VBA32 doesn't support a graphical interface, but it makes up for it in its detailed settings.

 There are plenty of options in this program, like choosing which drives to scan, defining a set of file types to scan, choosing to scan inside archives, and deciding a default action when a malicious file is detected.

 You can also adjust the heuristic scan settings and update virus definitions directly from the CD or USB drive.

 The obvious downfall to VBA32 Rescue is that you must use it in a text-only mode, unlike most of these other tools that have a regular user interface.

## An Alternative Method

 Another way to scan for viruses during the boot process is to use an antivirus tool that includes a 'rescue disk' option (some software might call it something else).[Avast Free Antivirus](https://www.avast.com/en-us/free-antivirus-download#pc) and[AVG AntiVirus Free](https://www.avg.com/en-us/free-antivirus-download#pc) are some examples.

## Do You Need a Bootable Antivirus Program?

 Why are these tools so important? If you've ever had such a terrible virus that your[computer won't start](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-computer-that-wont-turn-on-2624450) at all, it's hard to know what to do next because, well, your system won't boot up!

 However, with one of these scanners, you create a special flash drive or disc from a working computer and then use it on the infected machine to scan the hard drive for viruses—all without needing to start Windows! It'd be hard to count how many times I've been relieved to have a couple of bootable antivirus discs on hand.

 Since the most serious of viruses cause damage to the parts of your computer that allow it to start, a bootable virus checker can often be a powerful weapon at your disposal for getting the virus removed and your computer back up and running.
