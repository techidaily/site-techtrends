## Easy Ways to Express with Emoji: Complete iPhone Companion Guide
 To use[emoji](https://www.lifewire.com/amazing-facts-about-emoji-3486026) on an iPhone, you only need to activate the built-in emojis keyboard in your iOS operating system. Apple has made emoji keyboards available for free on all iPhones since it rolled out the iOS 5.0 operating system.

 Once activated, the built-in emoji keyboard appears at the bottom of your smartphone screen where the regular keyboard appears when you’re composing messages—only instead of letters, the emoji keyboard shows rows of those little cartoon-like pictures known as “emoji” or smiley faces.

## How to Activate Emoji Keys

 To activate the emoji keys on your iPhone:

1. Open the Settings app and tap on**General** .
2. Tap on**Keyboards** to see your keyboard settings.
3. Tap**Add New Keyboard** .
4. You should now see a list of available keyboards in various languages. Scroll down and look for the one labeled "Emoji." Yes, Apple considers "emoji" a type of language and lists it along with all the others!
5. Tap on**Emoji** and it will install the picture keyboard and make it available to you whenever you're typing anything.

## How to Use Emoji

 To access the emoji keyboard after it's activated, call your regular keyboard and look for a tiny globe icon at the bottom, below all the letters, right next to the microphone icon. Tapping the globe brings up the emoji instead of the regular keyboard letters.

 Swipe right to continue seeing additional groupings of emoji. Simply tap on any image, select it, and insert it into your message or post.

 When you want to return to your regular keyboard, just tap the tiny globe again, and it whisks you back to the alpha-numerical keyboard.

## What Does 'Emoji' Mean?

 You may be wondering what emojis are and how they differ from[emoticons](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-emoticons-in-comments-2654737) . Emoji are picture characters. The word itself is derived from Japanese, which refers to a graphic symbol used to represent a concept or idea. They’re similar to emoticons, only broader because they don’t just express emotions like[smileys](https://www.lifewire.com/graphical-smileys-outlook-mail-1164542) and other emoticons do.

 Emoji is a linguistic mashup that literally comes from the Japanese words for "picture" and "characters." Emojis got their start in Japan and are wildly popular in Japanese mobile messaging platforms; they have since spread worldwide and are used in a variety of social media apps and communication systems.

 Many of the emoji images have been adopted into the global computer text-coding standard known as Unicode. The[Unicode Consortium](http://unicode.org/) , the group that maintains the Unicode standard, adopted a whole new set of emoticons as part of an updated Unicode standard in 2014\. You can see examples of popular emoticons on the[EmojiTracker website](http://www.emojitracker.com/) .
