## How to Fix Microsoft.directx.directinput.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented here to address the simpler fixes first.

 Do not download the microsoft.directx.directinput.dll DLL file individually from any "DLL download site." There are a number of reasons[why downloading DLLs from these sites is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, delete it from wherever you saved it, and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The microsoft.directx.directinput.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version will fix the microsoft.directx.directinput.dll not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application DVD or CD. Sometimes the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc if their game or program utilizes DirectX.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available from Microsoft.
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with microsoft.directx.directinput.dll and a reinstall could do the trick.
5. [Restore the microsoft.directx.directinput.dll file from the latest DirectX software package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your error, try extracting this DLL file individually from the DirectX downloadable package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations, updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.
