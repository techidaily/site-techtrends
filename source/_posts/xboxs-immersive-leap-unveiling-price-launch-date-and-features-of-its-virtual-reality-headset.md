 The Xbox VR Headset is in the works. It's the first confirmed third-party headset built on Meta's open-source Meta Horizon OS, now open to and in use by other tech companies—including Asus, Lenovo, and ROG. Beyond a[ confirmation from Meta](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/) about a "limited-edition Meta Quest, inspired by Xbox," details are slim. But here's what we know and speculate about this first-ever VR Headset for Xbox.

##  When Will the Xbox VR Headset Be Released?

 The Xbox VR Headset release date hasn’t been announced yet, but judging by the announcements of the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3, we think it’s safe to expect an October release of the VR Headset for Xbox.

* **Meta Quest 2 release date** : October 13, 2020
* **Meta Quest Pro release date** : October 25, 2022
* **Meta Quest 3 release date** : October 10, 2023

 We might know more availability specifics if and when the Meta Quest Gaming Showcase happens (no word yet about dates). Last year’s event was announced in May and held June 1.  

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 An early October 2024 Xbox VR Headset release date is a fair bet based on past Meta Quest releases.

##  Xbox VR Headset Price Rumors

 Pricing information isn’t yet circulating, but we’ll make sure it lands here as soon as there’s more chatter or official word.

## Pre-Order Information

 No pre-order details for the Xbox VR Headset are available at this point, though we know it’s billed as a limited-edition model. As soon as we learn more, we’ll update this story with details.

## Xbox VR Headset Features

 Much like everything else related to this forthcoming Xbox VR Headset, we’re still waiting on details about which features this device will offer. 

 Here are a few clues about the look and functionality based on Meta’s Horizon OS announcement.

Meta

* **Signature Xbox design** : While not an official product rendering, the image Meta offered in its announcement about Meta Horizon OS shows a black and green VR headset, a hallmark color scheme across Xbox gaming consoles.
* **Access to more content** : Another way Meta Horizon OS is expanding to third parties is by opening its Store to developers with software that meets basic requirements. The ultimate goal is that users will have access to and can play games on any headset built on Horizon OS.
* **Game Pass and Xbox controller** : In an Instagram stream announcing Meta Horizon OS, Mark Zuckerberg also alluded to the inclusion of[ Game Pass](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-game-pass-4178809) and an Xbox controller shipped with Xbox Horizon OS headsets.

##  Xbox VR Headset Specs and Hardware

 There’s some speculation that the[ VR headset for Xbox will take shape mostly as a version of Meta Quest 3](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137334/xbox-vr-headset-microsoft-meta-quest-limited-edition) . If that’s the case, we might see the following:

* 128GB and 512GB versions
* Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip
* 4K+[ Infinite Display](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/vr-display-optics-pancake-lenses-ppd/)
* 3D spatial audio
* [ Mixed reality](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/mixed-reality-definition-passthrough-scene-understanding-spatial-anchors/) with RGB cameras.
