 There are whispers of a new, cheaper version of the[ Meta Quest 3](https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-3-news-specs-rumors-5220120) â€“ the Meta Quest 3 Lite (aka Meta Quest 3s). While your wallet won't take as big of a hit, you might have to deal with the same display resolution as the Quest 2 (from 2020). Here's everything you can expect from Meta's upcoming VR headset.

##  When Will Meta Quest 3 Lite Be Released? 

 If the rumors are accurate, the Quest 3 Lite will arrive this year. We're just not sure_when_ . The Quest 3 was unveiled in June 2023 and released in October. If this year follows a similar pattern, Meta could announce the next headset any day now. Otherwise, they might wait until[ Meta Connect](https://www.meta.com/connect/) in September.

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 We think the Meta Quest 3s will be available for purchase by the end of September 2024.

##  Meta Quest 3 Lite Price Rumors 

 The Quest 3 Lite[ might cost around $200](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jTB63jxbik84eoRWBTLJ0Q) . If this is true, VR will be a lot more affordable for more people. For some perspective, the Quest 2 launched at $300, and the Quest 3 costs $500\. There's also the $3,000+[ Vision Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/is-the-apple-vision-pro-worth-it-8636202) , but we can hardly compare this model with Apple's beast of a headset.

## Pre-Order Information 

 There's no word yet on pre-orders for the Quest 3 Lite. Meta will probably allow pre-ordering following the headset's unveiling.

## Meta Quest 3 Lite Features 

 We don't know everything for sure, but expect the Quest 3 Lite to be a more basic VR headset to keep the price down. It might not be as powerful or have as sharp a picture as the Quest 3, but you'll still be able to play VR games and apps.

##  Meta Quest 3 Lite Specs and Hardware 

 Some supposed leaked material from a Meta presentation gives us a glimpse at what the headset might look like. The Meta Quest 3s (on the left, pictured below) includes six cameras positioned in two triangular sets. These are likely full-color, passthrough cameras. Meta's Director of Engineering for XR Tech[ Paul Furgale is "convinced that Passthrough and MR will be a standard feature on all future headsets" following the Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ai-powered-technologies-quest-3-pro-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/) .  

 You'll notice the overall design is flatter than the Quest 3, making it look more like the[ Oculus Go](https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298) . This leak also tells us its per-eye resolution of 1832x1920 is the same as the Quest 2, and the storage options are 128 GB and 256 GB (half that of the Quest 3). To keep its price lower, we also expect there to be less RAM in this headset (the Quest 3 has 8 GB).

 Although that leak doesn't mention it, we're sure the Quest 3 Lite will have a faster processor than the Quest 2\. It'll likely use the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, the same one from the Quest 3\. The Quest 2 uses the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 1.

 We've also heard that the Quest 3 Lite might come in two models, including a more affordable option that omits the controllers. With hand-tracking technology already present in current headsets, it's not far-fetched to think this could be how it works for the entry-level Quest 3s. Otherwise, the Quest 3s will ship with Touch controllers like other Meta headsets.
