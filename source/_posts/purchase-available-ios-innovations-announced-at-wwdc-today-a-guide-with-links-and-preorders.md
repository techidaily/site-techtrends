## Is it worth upgrading to a new MacBook Air 15, Mac Studio, or Mac Pro?

If you recently made the switch from an Intel-based Mac to one with an M1 or M2 chipset, you might want to hold off on upgrading to these latest models. The M2 Ultra is a brand-new chip from Apple, and will have some growing pains as driver updates get released to smooth over bugs and other performance issues real-world users may have. These new devices are also on the more expensive side, so you might want to wait for a promotional sale or for when your M1/M2 Mac starts to have serious issues. 

## What's the difference between the M2 Max and M2 Ultra?

The biggest difference comes down to how many cores each chip has as well as the maximum amount of supported memory. The M2 Max supports up to 96GB of unified RAM and features an 8-core CPU and 10-core CPU. The M2 Ultra supports up to 192GB of unified memory and features a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine. This means that the M2 Ultra can perform more processes per second, giving you higher performance over Intel and M1-based Apple models.
