## Part 4\. Pros and Cons of Ripping DVD to NAS over USB/Cloud/Hard Drive

Ripping DVD to a NAS drive has obvious advantages over [copying DVD to USB](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), Cloud, or hard drive. 

Pros:

To play movies on USB/hard drive, you have to plug in USB here and there.

What's more, USB flash drive and hard drive are easily damaged and get lost. 

How about storing and [uploading DVDs to Cloud](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) like iCloud, Dropbox for easier viewing on iPhone iPad Android computer? Many blames involve in the safety issue and monthly charges.

 All the embarrassments are gone with a NAS. NAS is your private cloud drive and media server with the ability to store thousands of DVD contents, meantime, it has no limits on when and where you can access your DVD collections on NAS as storage like XBMC and Boxee do via iPhone, iPad, Android devices, game consoles, TVs. 

Cons:

 But you should know NAS has limits before you decide to copy DVD collections to NAS. A NAS device is not cheap and a bit complicated to start with for non tech-savvy.

And some contents, if saved in unfriendly formats, mightbe incompatible with the streamers. 

 Even though it's easy to rip DVD to NAS media server, it's hard to manage the ripped DVD files if without any third party help. Users are advised to setup Plex or Roku media server to reduce bandwidth usage, or manage, transcode and play DVD movies on NAS.

_**Note:** The MacXDVD software calls for copying or ripping DVD under the concept of Fair Use and does not encourage any illegal distribution of copyrighted content. Please abide by the local DVD copyright law before doing it._
