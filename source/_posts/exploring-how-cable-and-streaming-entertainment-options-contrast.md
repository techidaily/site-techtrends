## Previous Google Events

 At Google's last event, the keynote for[Google I/O 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/google-io-5097160) , the company talked almost exclusively about its Gemini AI platform. They showed off features that give you summaries of email threads and spreadsheets and an "AI Teammate" that you can add to Workspace to keep track of projects.

 The significant addition to search lets you incorporate videos like you can already use images. It's called Search With Video, and the examples they showed involved recording a malfunctioning record player and getting troubleshooting tips to fix it.

 You can watch the entire event below.
