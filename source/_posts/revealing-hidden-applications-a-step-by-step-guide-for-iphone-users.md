### Tip  

 The reverse video filter is about the eighth filter when swiping to the left. You can find the reverse filter by swiping right through filters, but that will take you longer to get to it. Some filters let you speed up your video snap (**rabbit** filter) or slow it down (**snail** filter).
3. Optionally, add more effects (text, stickers, drawings, etc.) to your video snap. Tap**Send To** to send it to friends and/or post it to your stories.

## When to Apply the Reverse Filter on Video Snaps

 Reversing your video snaps is a fun way to showcase a series of events backward. This filter is often best applied to action-packed videos.

 For example, consider something as simple as dropping a rock onto a frozen pond that breaks through the ice. Instead of watching the ice shatter at the end of the video, you could apply the reverse filter to show the fractured ice coming back together as the video footage plays backward.
