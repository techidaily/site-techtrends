## ABBYY Expands Strategic Partnerships to Accelerate Modernization of Government Agencies

April 25, 2023

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) announced it has expanded its partnerships that serve state and local government agencies. Data from the Government Accountability Office revealed that [federal IT legacy systems cost over $330 million annually to maintain](https://itif.org/publications/2022/10/24/federal-hisp-digital-customer-experience/), while delivering sub-optimal service and carrying risks inherent to older platforms. To address the agencies’ needs to modernize both back-end and consumer-facing IT systems, ABBYY partnerships will expand the accessibility of its intelligent automation solutions to streamline cumbersome processes, enhance citizen experiences and improve the overall ability to meet constituents’ needs.

Among ABBYY’s expanded partnerships is [MCCi](https://mccinnovations.com/), which was recently named as a company to watch in the annual [GovTech 100](https://www.govtech.com/100). MCCi has numerous ongoing initiatives to digitally transform government services, including unemployment and Social Security fraud mitigation and accounts payable automation. The city of Coppell, Texas is among their customers that have successfully automated accounts payable processes using ABBYY intelligent document processing solutions to turn key document insights into efficient outcomes. By leveraging ABBYY technology, Coppell reduced invoice processing time from days to minutes.

Right out of the box, ABBYY intelligent document processing was very impressive. We gave it a dozen of our invoices, and it processed with 99% accuracy on 90% of those. It uses machine learning, so once it’s corrected, the next time an invoice from that vendor comes through, ABBYY understands it and will process it with 100% accuracy.

_Jerod Anderson, director of Enterprise Solutions for the city of Coppell_

Additionally, MCCi holds a contract with the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) where ABBYY is a part of an approved distributor solution. ABBYY is also approved through several other government contracts, including the State of New York Information Technology Umbrella Contract, the State of California Software License Program, and the NASPO ValuePoint Cooperative Purchasing Contract via Carahsoft. Furthermore, our approval through Carahsoft has [enabled state agencies to leverage ABBYY IDP and Proof of Identity in the motor vehicle sector](https://www.carahsoft.com/learn/event/41517-ai-powered-onboarding-for-a-frictionless-user-experience) to expedite document review and identity verification and proofing.

Our expanded partnership with ABBYY to serve the public sector is crucial because in many cases paper processes are necessary to provide services to constituents caught in the digital divide. Paper forms do not have to slow modernization efforts. Clients like Coppell, TX are accelerating their adoption of automation technologies because of all the aforementioned drivers and are having proven, repeated success in improving their citizens’ experience.

_Donny Barstow, CEO of MCCi_

As citizens grow accustomed to exemplary customer experiences provided by Amazon and banking institutions, their expectations of government entities evolve. For example, a recent ABBYY survey identified the top three factors contributing to the public dropping out of registration for government services as taking too much time/too many steps (54%), requiring excessive and repetitive manual entry (50%), and making identity verification too difficult (26%).

Agencies in the public sector work with trusted, best-in-breed solutions that are scalable and easy to deploy. We have the expertise to address the growing document-centric challenges of these agencies, especially as rises in unemployment claims increase the need to accelerate processing while mitigating fraud risk. MCCi has deep connections and understands the public sector, enabling them to navigate citizens’ weariness toward poor service experiences. Strategic partnerships like these are instrumental to our growth and contributions in the public sector.

_Bruce Orcutt, SVP of Product Marketing at ABBYY_
