Popcorn Time stutters on Mac

**Movie won't start or playback is stuttering**: Popcorn Time helps to download files on your Mac with the aid of Bittorrent protocol while playing them at the same time, which means you can download the popular contents at high speeds for smooth playback but have to be patient in case you stumble upon some virtually unknown stuff, leading to annoying choppy playback on your Mac or no sound issue.

To tackle the issue, you can just try another source/torrent, look for high numbers of peers. Or else, go do something else after you press pause and resume playback afterwards. If these solutions won't work for you, just try third-party software like [YouTube downloader for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

Popcorn Time for Mac apps on this website are beta-versions, which means they're still under development. Plus, it is often caused by the misconfigured system files that create registry errors within your Mac OS.

That's why OS X users constantly suffer from no audio or are told the movie is damaged. 

If you come across the problems, you are advised to shut down the app and start it up again; restart your Mac computer; or remove the app, redownload and install it on your Mac again.
