“Our Digital Intelligence solutions enable legal professionals to easily digitize, edit, and enhance documents to streamline e-discovery, contract review, and other legal processes,” commented Kristin Wagener, Senior Director of Global Application Software Sales at ABBYY. “A recent [survey](https://www.aderant.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-Business-of-Law-Survey-Results.pdf "Survey") found that increasing operational efficiencies is the biggest challenge facing law firms today. Our suite of products provides legal professionals with tools to effectively manage document processes and increase efficiencies in legal workflows.”
