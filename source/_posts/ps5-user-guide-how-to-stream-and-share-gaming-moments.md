 FAQ

* What does "No Caller ID" mean?  
 A caller who shows as "No Caller ID" is hiding their number. They do this to make their calls harder to block or track, especially if they're involved in scams.
* How do I find out who called if they have no caller ID?  
 Because the caller is masking their identity by hiding their number, it's hard to find out exactly who it is. It doesn't really matter, however, because almost every time you see a call like this, the person calling is up to no good. It's best and easiest to take the above steps to block them, or don't answer when you see "No Caller ID."
