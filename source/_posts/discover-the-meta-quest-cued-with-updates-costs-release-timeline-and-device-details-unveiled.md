##  Meta Quest 3 Features & Specs

 Quest 3 boasts enhanced visuals through a high-resolution display with 2,064 x 2,208 pixels per eye and pancake optics, supported by a next-gen chipset (Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2) for superior graphical performance. It introduces[ Meta Reality technology](https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/mixed-reality-definition-passthrough-scene-understanding-spatial-anchors/) , which merges the physical and virtual worlds, allowing for natural interactions and immersive experiences.
