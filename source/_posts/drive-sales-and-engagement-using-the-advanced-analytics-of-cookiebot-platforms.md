### Helping the Fortune 500 company achieve organizational excellence has also won ABBYY recognition with CIO Magazine

Commercial real estate giant, JLL, saved millions by automating invoicing and payments globally by using ABBYY’s cloud-based [intelligent document processing solutions](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). Its S2P project led to this Fortune 500 company, with annual revenue of $19.4 billion, to be selected as a CIO 100 company by CIO Magazine for "Technology Innovation and Business Value driven by the Source-to-Pay Program."

ABBYY was also recognized by CIO Magazine as a "[Solutions Partner to 2022 Winner USA CIO 100](https://www.cio.com/article/308238/the-tech-behind-the-2022-us-cio-100-winners-celebrating-the-cio-100-solutions-partners.html)“, for helping JLL drive digital business growth through innovation.

“Driving digital business growth requires working with trusted partners like ABBYY whose cloud-based intelligent document processing solution was instrumental to the success of our multi-year, global, source-to-pay program.  
  
Automating our invoice and payment strategy and rolling it out globally in multiple languages resulted in significant savings. This project exceeded our business goals, and we are honored to have its success validated by the prestigious CIO 100 award.”

_Bruce Beck, CIO Corporate Functions at JLL_

Those recognized set a new standard for the use of enterprise technology in achieving organizational excellence.

“We have partnered with JLL on their source-to-pay program since 2019, and together we built a global program that accelerated their business processes across the globe using our intelligent process automation solutions.  
  
It was an enormous project that achieved high automation goals and improved their payment strategy resulting in millions in saving. We are thrilled to see how our contribution to their digital transformation strategy enabled JLL to receive such high accolades as a CIO 100 winner.”
