## How to Fix It When Your Samsung Soundbar Isn't Working

 The troubleshooting steps below should help get your Samsung soundbar working again. Try each step in order, working through them until you find the solution to your problem.

1. Disconnect and then[reconnect your soundbar](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-tv-to-external-audio-system-1846816) . Cables that aren't seated well or in the wrong connections could prevent your soundbar from working correctly. Disconnect all the cables and then reconnect them to see if this might fix your issue.  
 Also, be sure to disconnect your power cable. Don't plug it back in until all the other connections are reseated securely to allow the soundbar to read the connections correctly.
2. Make sure the soundbar is set to the correct source. It seems like a simple solution, but if your soundbar is set to a different source than you're using, you might not hear any sound from it at all.
3. Make sure the source is on. It's another simple solution that can sometimes be a sure fix. If the source for your audio isn't powered on, it won't transmit any audio data to the soundbar, so it can seem as if your soundbar isn't working.
4. Ensure your TV is[set up to use external speakers](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-and-set-up-a-sound-bar-4138615) and that the soundbar is your default speaker. Depending on the model of television you have, it might not automatically detect your soundbar. In your television's settings, make sure you've chosen the correct settings to use your soundbar as your primary source of audio.
5. Disconnect and then reconnect the Bluetooth connection. Depending on the device you're connecting to, the steps for removing and reconnecting to Bluetooth might differ. However, if there is a bad Bluetooth connection, walking through those steps could get the soundbar working again.
6. Soft reset your soundbar. Turn off your TV, disconnect all the cables, and wait two minutes. Then reconnect everything and turn your TV back on to see if everything might work again. It will sometimes work if there is static or other electrical interference in the line.
7. Hard reset the soundbar. Sometimes a reset is all you need to get the soundbar working again. Power**Off** the soundbar and then press and hold the**Play/Pause** button on it until it displays**INIT OK** . Then release the button and power the soundbar**On** again. You'll have to walk through the steps for pairing the soundbar to your TV again.

 FAQ

* How do I connect a Samsung soundbar to a TV?
