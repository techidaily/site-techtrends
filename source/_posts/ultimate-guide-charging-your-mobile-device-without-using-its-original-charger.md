## What Is the Alt Code for a Heart?

 You can type out a heart symbol instantly on Windows if you know the[alt code](https://www.lifewire.com/typing-symbols-characters-on-windows-mac-4691496) . For example, holding down**Alt+3** on your keyboard’s number pad will produce a simple heart. However, there are many other codes you can use to make different heart emojis.

 Things work a little differently on Macs, as the Apple keyboard uses option keys to insert symbols. However, you’ll have to change your keyboard settings to use the Unicode Hex Input method to do this.

 It’s much easier to use**Cmd+Ctrl+Space** and bring up the emoji keyboard, as Unicode is a complicated, somewhat limited method.
