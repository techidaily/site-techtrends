## How to Fix Advrcntr2.dll Errors

 Follow these steps to fix the error when it applies to Nero.

 Do not, under any circumstances, download advrcntr2.dll from any "DLL download site." There are several reasons why[downloading DLLs like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, delete it from wherever you put it and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . The advrcntr2.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. Record the[serial number](https://www.lifewire.com/serial-number-2626008) of your particular Nero installation. One easy way to do this is with a product key finder program.
3. Uninstall Nero from your computer.  
 You can uninstall the program using the_Uninstall Nero_ link in the_Nero_ program group (if available) or via the_Programs and Features_ or_Add/Remove Programs_ applet in[Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/control-panel-2625841) . Another option is to use a[free uninstaller tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188) .
4. Restart your computer.
5. [Download the free Nero General CleanTool](https://ccm.net/downloads/security-and-maintenance/6225-nero-general-clean-tool/) and then extract and run it. This utility will ensure that Nero is 100 percent removed from your computer.  
 This file is in the[ZIP format](https://www.lifewire.com/zip-file-2622675) . Unzip it from within Windows or use a dedicated file unzipper like[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) .  
 Nero General CleanTool is only guaranteed to work up through Nero 9\. Newer versions of Nero should uninstall more completely via the standard uninstall method in Step 3, but feel free to try CleanTool if you like.
6. Restart your computer again, just to be safe.
7. Reinstall Nero from your original installation disc or downloaded file. Hopefully, this step should restore the advrcntr2.dll file.
8. Install the latest update to your Nero program if there's one available. There may have been certain issues in your original version of Nero that caused the error you've been seeing.
9. Restart your computer... again.
10. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) if the Nero reinstallation steps don't resolve your issue. Some advrcntr2.dll issues are actually related to hostile programs that masquerade as the advrcntr2.dll file.  
 The advrcntr2.dll file should be located in the_C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Ahead\\Lib_ folder. If you find the advrcntr2.dll file in the_C:\\Windows_ or_C:\\Windows\\System32_ folder, chances are it's not Nero's legitimate DLL file.

 This file might go "missing" because it was accidentally deleted, because an antivirus or other security program mistakenly removed it thinking it was a security threat, or due to an issue when you last upgraded or reinstalled[Nero](https://www.nero.com/) .

 Advrcntr2.dll errors may show up a few different ways depending on how it was generated. Here are the more common errors that people see:

* **This program requires the file advrcntr2.dll, which was not found on this system.**
* **File advrcntr2.dll not found**
* **ADVRCNTR2.DLL MISSING**

 Most advrcntr2.dll "not found" errors are due to issues with the Nero CD and DVD burning software program. This[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) is a file that must exist in the correct folder for Nero to burn CDs or DVDs.

 The error most likely applies to Nero v7 only, but it might be associated with other versions, too, and could be seen on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) that Nero is compatible with.

 These errors may also appear when Nero isn't installed, if the computer is infected with certain kinds of viruses or other malware.
