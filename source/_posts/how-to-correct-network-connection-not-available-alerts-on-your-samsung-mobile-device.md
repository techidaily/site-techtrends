## How Do I Register My Samsung Network?

 Follow these steps in order until your phone is working properly:

1. [Restart your Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-android-smartphone-or-tablet-4127180) . Rebooting your device will clear out any temporary conflicts preventing you from connecting to the network.
2. [Turn off Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/when-and-how-to-turn-off-wifi-818302) . Disable Wi-Fi on your phone, wait for 30 seconds, then turn it back on. This resets your connection and can resolve temporary technical hiccups.
3. [Update your Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/update-your-android-os-121662) . Make sure your operating system and firmware are current. Sometimes, updates contain fixes to specific problems like this error.  
 If you rooted your Android phone, you will need to unroot it before you can install updates.
4. [Reinsert the SIM Card](https://www.lifewire.com/insert-sim-card-into-smartphone-4777486) . Take out your SIM card and make sure it's not damaged, and then put it back in place. Make sure the card is set properly in the tray with the metal pins in the right position.
5. Manually choose your network. Make sure the correct carrier is selected in your settings. Go to**Settings** \>**Connections** \>**Mobile Networks** \>**Network Operators** \>**Search now** and select your carrier's network.

6. [Change the network mode](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-5g-on-samsung-s20-5188203) . If you're in a low reception area that doesn't support 5G or 4G, it's best to switch to 3G or 2G.
7. Contact your mobile carrier. Go to a store, or use another phone to call your provider so they can help you resolve the issue. It could be that there's a network outage in your area, so all you can do is wait. If there's a problem with your SIM card, your carrier can help you replace it.
8. [Update APN settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-apn-settings-on-your-mobile-device-2377931) . If you recently changed service providers, you may need to update the[Access Point Name (APN)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apn-access-point-name-2377408) settings. This is an advanced fix, so be careful and write down the default APN settings so you can change them back if something goes wrong.
9. [Reset the network settings](https://help.republicwireless.com/hc/articles/115012387128-How-to-Reset-Network-Settings-on-Samsung-Galaxy-Phones-on-Android-7-0-or-Higher) . Establishing a fresh connection to your carrier's network can fix problems a reboot can't. Resetting network settings will erase all Wi-Fi passwords and Bluetooth connections, so save this step as a last resort.
10. Use a different SIM card. If you have a spare activated SIM card, switch it in and see if your phone can connect to the network. If it can, there's an issue with your original SIM card.  
 Before you buy a new one,[check Samsung's support website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2F) to see which SIMs are compatible with your Samsung Galaxy.
