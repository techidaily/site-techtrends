### What's the best gaming laptop deal on Prime Day?

There are a lot of great gaming laptops on sale right now, but in our opinion, [this deal on the Razer Blade 16](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Gaming-Laptop-4090-13th/dp/B0BQP1WCP4?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20) is the best. We're talking $1,000 off one of the most high-end gaming laptops on the market, with hardware that is future-proofed to be relevant for years to come. 

### Is Amazon Prime Day a good time to buy a laptop?

Even though Amazon isn't typically the first place you think of when you're shopping for a new laptop, there are some great deals that pop up if you're willing to look. We've thoroughly combed through the deals to find some diamonds in the rough, and listed the best ones here.

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

At ZDNET, we only write about deals our team members would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. We looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. These recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
