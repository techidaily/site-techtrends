When a DVD owner converts a disc to a digital format, he may want to keep all the content of the DVD if possible. MKV is the format that will contain all the video, audio, subtitle tracks, chapters, and menus of a DVD without quality loss.

You may just want to extract the DVD video to MKV format, untouched. In this post, we will show you the right way to rip DVD to MKV without re-encoding.

## Part 1\. Reasons for Ripping DVD to MKV

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a11.png)1\. Ripping DVD will Remove DVD Copy Protections** 

Similar to Blu-ray, DVD disc is also equipped with a variety of protections to prevent DVD content from illegal use. The most popular encryption techs include CSS encryption, Sony ARccOS encryption, RCE Region protection, Disney X-project DRM, region code etc. DVD rippers can bypass DVD copy protections and deliver a DRM-free file. But sometimes you may encounter errors while working with [DVD ripping freeware](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/) like MakeMKV, HandBrake and Freemake Video Converter. 

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a10.png)2\. DVD to MKV Backup can Reserves All DVD Content**

If you have ever [encoded DVD movies into MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/), AVI, or MPEG format, and been slightly frustrated with the loss of DVD extra elements, then you can switch to MKV as the DVD backup format. MKV is able to contain all detailed chapter information, sub-chapters, titles, multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, attachments and custom metadata.

**![](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/general-img/a7.png)3\. MKV Container Is as Universal as MP4 with High Quality**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Since MKV supports any type of video/audio tracks and subtitles inside, and is quite efficient for storage and streaming, it's widely used on video transmitting. Usually, common DVD rippers can help rip a 4-8 GB DVD movie to a digital file in hundreds of MB, but you will get much quality loss. Only some seasoned DVD to MKV backup tools balance well on video file size and DVD ripping speed.

The famous media player VLC offers the ability to convert DVDs to MKV and various other formats. Some users may already have it on their computer. So there's a good chance that you don't need to get extra software to rip DVDs to MKV. 

However, there are things you need to know when ripping DVDs to MKV using VLC. VLC doesn't support DVDs with copy protections, though it has no problem playing them.

**Step 2.** From the top menu bar, click Media and then choose Convert/Save. Then click on the Disc tab to select and load your DVD. Then you need to:

* Check the "No disc menus" box to avoid VLC makeing mistakes with the DVD menus.
* If you need to rip a protected DVD, here is a workaround. Play the DVD using a DVD player and mark down the correct DVD title. Then enter the DVD title and chapter in VLC under Starting Position. But this method doesn't work all the time.

![VLC protected DVD to MKV](https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/../seo-img/dvd-ripper/rip-chapters-off-dvd-vlc.jpg) 

**Step 3.** Click the Convert/Save button and then you'll need to select the output profile. Open the Profile dropdown menu and check if there is an MKV profile. By default, VLC will choose to rip DVDs to "Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)". If there is no MKV option, click the gear button next to it and under Encapsulation, choose MKV and save it. 

**Step 4.** Choose an output destination folder and then click Start. VLC will then begin ripping DVDs to MKV.
