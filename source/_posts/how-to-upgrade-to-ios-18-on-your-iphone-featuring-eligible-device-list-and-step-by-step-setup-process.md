## How to install iOS 18

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

**What you need:** An iPhone running iOS 16.5 or later. Since not all iPhones are compatible with iOS 18, you'll also need a model [newer than the iPhone X](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/).

## 1\. Go to General in your iPhone Settings

Go to your iPhone's Settings and select General.

Apple Intelligence, featuring the company's AI tools, will begin to roll out for compatible iPhones over the next few weeks, with more features to join in the coming months. This slew of AI features will be available on the iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhones 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple released the iOS 18 developer beta during WWDC 2024 in June, and the public beta version was released on July 15\. The general release of iOS 18 is September 16.

### Can you still download the iOS 18 public beta?

You can always be part of the Apple Beta program to get the latest beta versions of iOS. Before you download a beta version of an operating system, you should have some housekeeping items in mind:

* Back up your device and personal information.
* Don't download beta software, which will likely have bugs and glitches, on your everyday iPhone.
* You should go into the experience to test new features and share feedback to improve iOS, which is why beta versions are released.

### How do I install the iOS 18 beta version?

You'll need an iPhone running iOS 16.5 or later. Since not all iPhones are compatible with iOS 18, you'll also need a model [newer than the iPhone X](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/).

1. Go to your iPhone's Settings and select General.
2. Go to Software Update in Settings.
3. Enable Beta Updates. To enable Beta Updates, go to Beta Updates and select the iOS version you'd like to access. This setting is turned off by default on iPhones.
4. Select iOS 18 Public Beta. Then you'll begin receiving automatic software updates to the latest beta version of iOS 18\. Apple currently has four beta versions of iOS: iOS 18 public beta, iOS 18 developer beta, iOS 17 public beta, and iOS 17 developer beta. These four options will soon be reduced to just the two iOS 18 variants. Once you do this, return to the previous page. If an update is available now, your iPhone will prompt you to download and install it.

### How to download the iOS 18 developer beta?

To download the iOS 18 developer beta version, navigate to your settings to install the iOS 18 developer beta if your device runs iOS 16.4 and is used with an Apple ID enrolled in the Apple Developer Program:

1. Go to your iPhone **Settings**
2. Tap on **General**
3. Select **Software Update**
4. Go to **Beta Updates**
5. Choose the **iOS 18 Developer Beta**
