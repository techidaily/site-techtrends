## Fix 1: Disable NVIDIA reflex

 NVIDIA Reflex uses GPU power to increase system responsiveness and decrease input latency. But it will sacrifice you a bunch of FPS. It’s turned on by default in the game. To turn it off, you need to set the value to 0\. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Exit your game.

2) In the search bar, copy and paste**%appdata%BungieDestinyPCprefs** .

3) Right-click on the**cvar.xml** file and select**Open with > Editor/ Notepad** .

4) Scroll down and find this line **<cvar name=”low\_latency\_mode” value=”1″ />** . Now you need to change the value to**0** .

 Once done, click on**File > Save** to save the changes.

 Now relaunch your game to check if it works. If you still get low FPS, you can delete that**cvars.xml** file.

## Fix 2: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Launch your Steam client.

2) From the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Destiny 2: Beyond Light** and select**Properties** from the menu.

3) When the Properties window opens, select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click the**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** tab. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes. Once complete, restart your game and check if it helps you improve your performance.

## Fix 3: Update your video card driver

 Your device drivers, the video card driver, in particular, are important components that greatly impact your computer’s performance. If you get low FPS when gaming, one of the recommended troubleshooting steps you should take is to update your video card driver especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you had it updated.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your video card driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your video card driver

 To update your video card driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your video card driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct version, download, and install them correctly.

Here’s how it works:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

![update drivers automatically with Driver Easy to fix Beyond Light FPS drops](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/scan-now-9-available.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer and play your game. You should be able to see a noticeable difference in performance.

## Fix 4: Turn off hardware acceleration

 By default, hardware acceleration is enabled in Chrome and Discord. This feature utilizes your computer’s GPU to tackle graphics-intensive tasks. But it can cause your computer’s battery to drain a lot faster. And when you have pretty low FPS in the game, hardware acceleration could be the culprit. In this case, you need to turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome and Discord.

### In Chrome

 1) At the top right, click on the three lines and then select**Settings** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-hardware-acceleration-Google-Chrome.png)

 2) Scroll down to the bottom and click on**Advanced** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration Google Chrome](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/advanced-disable-hardware-acceleration-Google-Chrome.png)

 3) Scroll down to the**System** section, and toggle off the option**Use hardware acceleration when available** . Then click**Relaunch** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration Google Chrome](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-google-hardware-acceleration.png)

### In Discord

 1) Open the Discord app. Click on **Settings** (the gear icon beside your avatar).  
  
![open Discord settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Discord-settings-2.jpg)

 2) On the left pane, navigate to**Appearance** . In this tab, scroll down to the**ADVANCED** section and toggle off the option**Hardware Acceleration** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration Discord](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Discord-disable-hardware-acceleration.png)

 After turning off hardware acceleration, try and play your game to check if it mitigates your issue.

## Fix 5: Temporarily disable background programs

 Ideally, we suggest you close programs that may be using the internet and system resources. It’s also a great way to make sure that no third-party programs are interfering with your game. To disable programs running in the background, take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .

 3) Go to the **Services**  tab. Check **Hide all Microsoft services** and click **Disable all** .

 4) Now go to the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager** .  
  
![terminate programs running in the background cold war error code blzbntbgs000003f8](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/terminate-programs-running-in-the-background.jpg)

 5) Under the **Startup**  tab, disable one task at a time (Right-click on each and select **Disable** .) Once done, restart your computer.
