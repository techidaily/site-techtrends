## Gain Control Over Your System by Rectifying the gsdll32.dll Not Found Problems Easily
 Gsdll32.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the Ghostscript gsdll32 [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, gsdll32.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Gsdll32.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to address the more likely solutions first.

 Don't download gsdll32.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file that way is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore gsdll32.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" gsdll32.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to undelete the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . Just be sure that it was working before it was deleted, and that it wasn't corrupted or malicious.  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Install the 32-bit version of Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) , which is the official provider of the gsdll32.dll file. Installing, or reinstalling Ghostscript should be enough to replace the missing or corrupt file and fix any related DLL errors.  
 If this installation doesn't correct the error, try searching for the file on your computer. It should be in here:  
 `C:\Program Files (x86)\gs\gs[version]\bin\`  
 Once you find it,[copy the DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) to the[system32 folder](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-32-4684415) :  
 `C:\Windows\system32\`  
 Some applications need the DLL file to exist there in order to use it.  
 Another way to get this file is to extract it out of the EXE download. Look for it in the**bin** folder.  
 Try your best to complete this step, and make sure you don't accidentally download the[64-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) version—it provides the_gsdll64.dll_ file instead. Installing the program that provides the gsdll32.dll file is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the gsdll32.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, and adding Ghostscript to your computer wasn't enough to fix the error, reinstalling the program should replace the file.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some DLL errors like this one are related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the file. It's even possible the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to this file. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file gsdll32.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, update the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The gsdll32.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
7. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if the errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
8. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair gsdll32.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid gsdll32.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners, but we've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
9. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the gsdll32.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the gsdll32.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
10. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any gsdll32.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
