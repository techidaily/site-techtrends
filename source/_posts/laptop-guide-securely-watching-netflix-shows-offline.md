## How Do I Watch Netflix Offline?  

 Anything you download from the Netflix app is available offline. To watch those items when you don't have an internet connection, simply open the My Downloads tab. To ensure you’re able to access Netflix videos offline, it’s recommended that you remain signed in to the app.  
 When offline, you’ll only be able to access the movies and shows you downloaded while you were online. If you try to navigate to a different menu, you’ll be greeted by the notification below:  
![Offline notification on Netflix Windows app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eyp7CHmXHgB9mgbPwO1dd8surUc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/010_how-to-download-netflix-movies-on-laptop-0421404d77b642a6bb44264615e50eca-1c9ece6e00ed4300a4d122c86b45d61e.jpg)  

## Why Can't I Download Movies on Netflix?  

 While the Netflix app is free to download, you’ll need an active subscription before you can sign in and start downloading things. See our[Netflix article](https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831) to learn more about the various plan options.  
[11 of Our Favorite Free Movie Download Sites for 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/download-free-movies-online-1356637)  
 Even with a subscription,[the number of devices that you can have downloads on](https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-people-can-watch-netflix-at-once-5192108) is limited by the plan you’re subscribed to. You can download movies to two devices with the Standard plans, or up to six devices with Premium.  
 If you’ve reached your device limit, you can remove devices linked to your account. Do this from the[Manage Access and Devices page of your account settings](https://www.netflix.com/manageaccountaccess) .  
 Here are some other possible reasons you can't download Netflix movies on your laptop:  

* **You're downloading too frequently** . Standard and Premium plans can have up to 100 active downloads per device at any given time.  
* **Too many videos have already been downloaded** . Ad-supported plans top out at 15 downloads per month per device.  
* **Windows is too outdated** . The app is only available for Windows 10 v10240 and higher (this includes Windows 11).[Update Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) if you can't install the app.
