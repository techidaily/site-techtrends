#### _The two companies will collaborate technologically to help enterprises digitize their businesses as well as create, deploy and operate their digital workforce platforms_

Manchester-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions provider Robiquity has entered into a new partnership with ABBYY, a global leader in Content IQ solutions and services, to incorporate cognitive technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.

The partnership will enable Robiquity to speed up its invoice and form recognition processing with FlexiCapture, ABBYY's AI-powered business-ready solution for automated invoice processing. In addition, Robiquity's RPA efforts will benefit from faster end-to-end processing time, greater spend visibility and multichannel invoice capture.

With the new partnership, Robiquity will be closing ranks with global RPA vendors like Blue Prism and UiPath; collaborating with both companies to utilize ABBYY's AI-driven capture technology to enhance customer experience and improve employee productivity.

Robiquity specialise in making RPA delivery, capability and training simple for all organisations. The integration of ABBYY intelligent technology into its offering will help bring new cognitive capabilities to its clients. Robiquity’s cutting-edge **ScaleSafe** programme will also leverage ABBYY innovative solutions to make organisations more efficient and agile.

Industry experts are predicting a heavy demand for RPA. By 2021, more than [4 million robots](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+RPA+Market+Will+Reach+29+Billion+By+2021/-/E-RES137229 "Forrester report robots in office administration") will be doing office administration and sales tasks while the RPA market [will grow to $2.9 billion](https://www.forrester.com/report/The+RPA+Market+Will+Reach+29+Billion+By+2021/-/E-RES137229 "Forrester projects growth of the RPA market"), according to Forrester. With greater adoption of robots, [a new trend is emerging](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/signals-for-strategists/cognitive-enterprise-robotic-process-automation.html "new trend: RPA and machine learning") in which enterprises are beginning to employ RPA together with cognitive technologies such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning to automate perceptual and judgment-based tasks once reserved for humans, according to Deloitte. The new trend has encouraged forward-thinking RPA solutions providers like Robiquity to power their offerings with AI-driven technology that ABBYY provides.

  
**Tom Gardner**, Robiquity co-founder commented:

"We are delighted to announce this partnership with ABBYY that will significantly strengthen our ability to deliver a high-impact RPA service offering to our clients. Working with a world-leading AI company like ABBYY opens up significant business benefits and opportunities and helps us provide consistently higher levels of service. It also helps us to bring into scope processes that wouldn’t ordinarily suit RPA, enabling us to do more for our existing and potential customers.”

  
**Neil Murphy**, VP of Global Business Development at ABBYY, stated:

"To have a fundamental impact on the workplace, robots need to be smarter, with the augmented ability to understand and interpret content like documents, images, text and other communications. Our partnership with Robiquity will ensure they get ABBYY’s content IQ technologies and solutions that make robots and processes smarter and more efficient, so that organisations can dramatically improve their customer experience and reduce operational costs.”

Robiquity will continue to maintain its focus on keeping RPA simple, while providing a wide range of pure RPA services both locally and overseas.
