## Top iPhone Offers and Discounts in July 2024 - Find Your Perfect Match

Shopping for a [new iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) can be a lengthy and sometimes stressful process, especially when a new generation of phones is announced. 

There's a lot to consider when deciding which model to get and looking for ways to save money on your purchase. Thankfully, carriers tend to launch frequent promotions on all of Apple's iPhone models. That means you're not locked into getting whatever the newest (and most expensive) iPhone is. But if the latest iPhone 15 is what you're after, we've found the best deals available.

If you know where to look, you can also find deals on models including the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and the iPhone 14, both carrier-locked and unlocked. You'll notice that many carrier deals have the potential to net you a free iPhone, including the latest models. Naturally, the devil's in the details (the fine print) for any smartphone deal. But that's why we're here.

Verizon customers purchasing an iPhone 15 can save $830, and no trade-in is required if they agree to sign up for an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.

## How did we choose these iPhone deals?

While researching the best Apple iPhone deals, we scoured the web and checked out major US retailers and telecoms' promotional prices, including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. 

We wanted to ensure we found the best iPhone deals, including the new flagship models and older variants. We've shown you the best discounts and trade-in offers, but remember that stocks can be limited and sales pulled at any time. 

Factors influencing our recommendations include:

* **Price**: The main factor we consider is the price. If the discount isn't noteworthy relative to the original price point -- or no trade-in offers are available -- then we don't consider it worthy of inclusion.
* **Variety**: Here at ZDNET, we want to provide you with a variety of iPhone options with bonuses. We've selected deals that bring down the price of your new handset, alongside bonus incentives such as free services or discounts on other devices in the Apple ecosystem.
* **Availability**: If we come across a great Apple deal but only a few units are in stock, unless it is a stellar saving you only see once in a blue moon, we will discount it and select a product with better stock levels instead.

## What is the best iPhone?

The best iPhone currently on the market is the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch model is the largest of the iPhone 15 line and comes stacked with Apple's latest features, such as a strong, lightweight titanium design, Dynamic Island, an A17 Pro chip, and a 48MP Main camera that shoots detailed imagery.

## When will the iPhone 16 come out?

While it's too early for us to know any definitive details, Apple typically refreshes its smartphone lineup once a year. 

However, if the iPad and iPhone maker follows its usual schedule, considering the iPhone 15 was launched in September 2023, we can expect an iPhone 16 to appear around September 2024.
