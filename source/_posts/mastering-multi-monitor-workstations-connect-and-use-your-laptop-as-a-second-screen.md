### Method 2: Disable your startup items

 Startup items mean the programs or processes that run automatically when your operating system starts. They can affect your Windows 10 system performance. You should check these items and disable the ones you don’t need.

 This will only stop those items from running automatically at startup. You can still open these programs or services.

To do so:

**1)** Right click any empty space of the taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .

**2)** Click the**Startup** tab, then disable the items you don’t need.

 If you’re not sure what an item is, do some research on the Internet to know what it is and if you can disable it.

 To disable a startup item, right click this item and click**Disable** .

### Method 4: Update your system

**1)** Click the**Start** button in the lower left corner of your screen, then click the**Settings** icon.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b2a2ce44241f.jpg)

**4)** Wait for Windows Update to update your operating system.

 Your system may also be running slow because you’re using a wrong device driver or it’s out of date. To see if that’s the case for you, you should update your device drivers. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

### Method 7: Check for virus or malware

 Virus or malware can slow down your Windows 10 system. They take up a lot of system resources and decrease your system performance. To see if that’s the case for you, you should check your computer for virus or malware. Run Windows Defender or the antivirus solution you’re using. If it finds any suspicious file or program, remove it and see if this restores your device performance.
