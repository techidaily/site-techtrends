##  Design: All-Around Convenience

 Available in Black, White, and Glacier Blue, the Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Wall Charger is 2.6 inches tall, 1.57 inches wide, 1.22 inches from front to back, and weighs just 0.38 pounds.

 The front side of the charger is where you’ll find its two USB-C ports and a single USB-A connection. The backside is where the plug is located, and I appreciate that Ugreen decided to use a foldaway design. It doesn’t take much force to fold out the two-prong plug, and the entire charger stays firmly plugged into the socket you connect it to.

 Complete portability is the name of the game for this Nexode Pro. It takes nothing to plug and unplug the device from a wall outlet, and the relatively flush design allows you to hide the device behind many desks and tables. It’s also small enough to tuck into whatever backpack, laptop sleeve, or purse you’re touting.

 Besides the charger itself, other box contents include a 16-inch [USB-C cable](https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypassing-steam-disconnection-in-windows-11/) and a user manual.

##  Features: GaN Charging at its Finest

 I’ve reviewed several [Ugreen products](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721452377806-issues-with-your-iphones-location-heres-how-you-can-fix-them/), and I’m always a fan of how much the company cares about protecting your devices. For instance, this 65W Nexode Pro includes a number of failsafe cutoffs. When your phone, tablet, or laptop is connected to the charger, the hardware receives protection from short circuits, overheating (billed as ThermalGuard), overcharging, and over-voltage.

 The Nexode Pro is also fantastic when it comes to heat dissipation. This is partly thanks to Ugreen’s GaNInfinity engineering, where gallium-nitride is used instead of silicone. GaN tech allows companies to design smaller components that are more energy-efficient and transmit less heat. Over the few weeks I tested the [wall charger](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), it never got toasty, even with the maximum number of devices plugged in.

 As far as charging capabilities go, the Nexode Pro delivers 65W max when just one USB-C port is being used, and 22.5W for solo usage of its single USB-A.

 When more than one USB-C port is used, the top port maxes out at 45W, and the bottom one at 20W. When USB-C and USB-A are used, the top USB-C maxes out at 45W, while USB-A is capped at 18W. When all three ports are in use, the top USB-C is capped at 45W, while the second USB-C and USB-A max out at 8.5W.

 The Nexode Pro also includes Ugreen’s SmartCharge technology, which delivers optimized charging to the devices that need it most (if you have more than one device connected).

##  Everyday Use: A Hardworking Charger

![The Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Wall Charger plugged into a wall outlet](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/the-ugreen-nexode-pro-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-plugged-into-a-wall-outletjpg_53347390804_o.jpg)

 I used the 65W Nexode Pro for several weeks, and now that it is packed up to be returned, I feel lost without the little device hanging out in my living room.

 I have an uncanny habit of letting battery-hungry apps run overnight on my iPhone 12 (the Roku app being the main culprit). When I wake up the next day, my phone’s battery life is often in the red, but I never worried about this with the Nexode Pro. I’d wake up, plug my phone into one of the USB-C ports (with no other devices connected), and by the time I finished preparing for the workday (about half an hour), my iPhone would be back to _at least_ 70% battery.

 Perfect for [mobile devices](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/), the Nexode Pro did a fantastic job at charging my second-gen AirPods Pro and Sony Bluetooth headphones too.

 While my living room was the primary hub for the gadget, I would also relocate it if I knew I was going to be hanging out in a specific room for a long time. Frankly, it was just nice to know that if I needed to charge something in a pinch (and my girlfriend and I often do), the Nexode Pro would take care of the job fast and efficiently.

 Normally, our go-to charging device is a mophie 20,000mAh [USB hub](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-joint-venture-campaigns-for-brands-on-video-platforms/), but the only time I took this device out was to plug it into the Nexode Pro because I knew it would charge the hub quickly. The wall charger also did a pretty decent job at charging my late 2020 M1 MacBook Pro, boosting me from 50% battery to just over 80% in about 40 minutes.

##  Should You Buy the Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Wall Charger?

 The [Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Wall Charger](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Gallium-Nitride-Charger-Black/dp/B091BGMKYS/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002195&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-pro-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) is a phenomenal charger that is lightweight, portable, and pretty dang powerful. It's a solid value, well under $50\. The foldaway plug makes it convenient to take the Nexode Pro just about anywhere, and Ugreen made sure to load up the charger with crucial failsafe features.
