## How Much Should You Spend on a TV?

 The right amount to spend on a TV depends on where you plan on using it and how big it needs to be. The size, resolution, and display type significantly determine a TV's sticker price. You can buy a smaller set with a better picture, a bigger TV with a lower-quality picture, or find the sweet spot in each price category.

 TVs priced below $300 are usually good for kids' and guest rooms, a TV under $600 can be a good choice for a primary bedroom or smaller living room, and most people will get by just fine with a budget of around $1,000 for a living room TV.

 If you want a better picture combined with a bigger screen, you can expect to pay more than that.

 Here’s a general guideline of what to expect at a variety of price points:  

| **Price Range** | **What to Expect**                                                                                                                                        | **Size**        | **Resolution & Display**     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| \> $300         | You won't get the latest display technology. When higher screen resolutions are available, the upscaling usually isn’t very good.                         | Up to 32-inches | 720 or 1080 LCD or LED       |
| $300-600        | 43-inch class TVs in this range are typically high-end with lots of features. Manufacturers have to cut corners to hit this price point for a 65-inch TV. | 40 to 65-inches | 1080 or 4K LCD, LED, or QLED |
| $600-1,000      | Occasionally, you'll find smaller OLED TVs at the upper end of this price range.                                                                          | 45 to 75-inches | 4K QLED                      |
| $1,000-2,000    | OLED is typically limited to 45 and 55-inch class TVs in this price range.                                                                                | 45 to 85-inches | 4K or 8K QLED or OLED        |
| $2,000-5,000    | You’ll find TVs with fantastic built-in sound, higher-quality materials, bezel-less designs, and other features at the higher end of this price range.    | 55 to 85-inch   | 4K or 8K QLED or OLED        |
| $5,000+         | Beyond this point, manufacturers offer futuristic features like rollable screens, massive 8K displays, and other luxury options.                          | 75 to 85-inch+  | 4K or 8K QLED or OLED        |

## What Resolution Should a TV Be?

 The correct resolution for a TV depends on the screen size and viewing distance. The exception is that if you want to play games on your[Xbox Series X](https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092) or[PlayStation 5](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089) in 4K or watch[UHD](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-4k-uhd-5199324) Blu-rays, you should choose a 4K TV regardless of other factors.

 You should generally select a TV with a higher resolution if you’re buying a large set and a lower resolution if your screen will be on the smaller side. If you’re buying a budget television for a guest room or child’s room, and it has a screen that’s 30 to 40 inches, then a[720p or 1080p resolution](https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378) may be satisfactory.

![A comparison of TV resolutions.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vfmib4nKwmei11vqGMqgDtT5g9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tvresolutioncomparison-38277cf416654c2097b6e626c61c0530.png)

 For a better quality picture, where you can’t make out the individual pixels on the screen, 4K is preferable, even for a 40-inch TV. Higher resolution[8K](https://www.lifewire.com/8k-resolution-beyond-4k-1846844) TVs provide diminishing returns, as 4K televisions already allow you to sit a comfortable distance from the screen, and there isn’t much native 8K video content available.  

| **Resolution** | **What It Means**                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 720p           | 720x1280 resolution (HD). Suitable for TVs under 32 inches. Pixels will be visible if you sit too close.       |
| 1080p          | 1080x1920 resolution (Full HD), Suitable for TVs under 42 inches. Pixels will be visible if you sit too close. |
| 4K             | 2160x3840 resolution (UHD). Suitable for all size TVs. Necessary for 4K gaming and UHD Blu-rays.               |
| 8K             | 4320x7680 resolution (UHD). Suitable for very large TVs. There is a lack of 8K content.                        |

## What’s the Right Screen Size For a TV?

 Like resolution, the correct screen size for a TV depends on the[viewing distance](https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-viewing-distance-3276294) or how far you plan on sitting from the TV. Smaller TVs are better for smaller rooms, while bigger TVs are better suited to large rooms where you can comfortably sit far away from the screen.

[How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/best-40-inch-smart-tvs-4586583)

 Televisions with higher-resolution displays allow you to sit closer without experiencing a reduction in picture quality. Higher-resolution displays have more individual pixels on the screen, so you can sit a lot closer without being able to make out the individual pixels. It’s the difference between the image on the TV looking like a solid picture versus being able to make out the series of dots of color that create the image.  

[How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159)

 To avoid seeing the individual pixels on the screen, you need to sit about twice as far away from a 1080p TV as a 4K TV of the same size.

 The easiest way to determine the correct size TV for your space is to measure the distance between the seating area and where you want to put the TV. If you’re getting a 1080p TV, divide that distance in half. If you’re getting a 4K TV, use the distance measurement without additional calculations. In both cases, the number you end up with is the biggest TV you can comfortably use in that space.  

 For example, let’s say your couch is seven feet away from the wall, or 84 inches. You could use a 42-inch 1080p TV or an 84-inch 4K TV. If you use a bigger TV, you can make out the individual pixels on the screen.

## What Display Type Should a TV Have?

 The type of display on your TV will depend mainly on your budget.[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091) provides the best picture quality, unparalleled contrast, and deep blacks. QLED displays get close and cost less, but they’re only available on more expensive TVs.

![A television mounted on a wall.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dxUBvwXqXuTOM9MVP5IlbH2rxLE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-1294829644-e09cd32c2a424206a27b020a7ad58748.jpg)

 Most TVs have[LED LCDs](https://www.lifewire.com/led-vs-lcd-3276283) , where the picture is displayed by an LCD screen and lit by LEDs. This setup can provide a high-quality picture, but lower-end displays often have hot spots where the lighting is brighter and can struggle to display dark blacks.

 Features like active and local dimming help LED LCD TVs to look better, with higher contrast ratios, and mini-LED backlighting and[quantum dot QLED](https://www.lifewire.com/quantum-dots-enhance-lcd-tv-performance-1847342) displays also help with those issues.

 OLED television displays use organic LEDs that are controlled pixel-by-pixel. That means that each pixel can be shut off independently of the others. This results in extremely high contrast ratios, as one part of the screen can display perfect black while another displays a bright, colorful image.

 OLED displays are the best, and they’re also the most expensive. Though LCD TVs can get brighter, high-end QLED TVs offer a good balance between price and picture quality.

## Should a TV Be Smart or Non-Smart?

 For better or worse, most TVs are[smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) at this point. Every year, finding a “dumb” TV gets more challenging, and even budget models come with built-in streaming platforms. If you set your sights on a non-smart TV, your options will be minimal.

 Instead of deciding between a smart or non-smart TV, it’s more helpful to focus on which smart TV platform you want.

 If you use[Fire TV sticks](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-4152887) or a[Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) , look for a TV with the platform you already use. That will make it much easier to transition from your old TV to your new one, and you won’t need to plug in any additional hardware.

 Some manufacturers have their own in-house smart TV platforms, but you always have the option to plug in your streaming device. Check how well the TV you’re interested in integrates external streaming devices; some do better than others.

## Who Should Buy a TV?

 You'll benefit from owning a TV if you fit into these categories:

* **Binge-watchers** . Whether you have stacks of DVDs and Blu-rays or subscribe to every streaming service under the sun, an appropriately sized HD or UHD TV will give your favorite shows way more room to breathe than your phone or laptop screen.
* **Cinephiles** . If you're a big fan of movies, nothing beats a nice[home theater setup](https://www.lifewire.com/essential-elements-of-home-theater-system-1846784) , starting with finding a suitable TV.
* **Parents** . If you're a one-TV household, you're probably tired of the kids arguing over what to watch, and many great budget-priced TVs can take care of that.
* **Gamers** . You're missing out if you've managed to get your hands on an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 but you're still gaming on an old 1080p TV. It would be best to have a 4K TV to take full advantage of current game systems.

## What Should I Do After I Buy a TV?

 If you're replacing an existing TV, your setup process will consist of swapping the new TV for the old one. Here's a quick rundown of some things you should do after you make your purchase:

* **Measure the installation area** . Measure the available space if you're replacing your TV with a bigger one. Even if the new TV is the same size class, it may be thicker, thinner, or have slightly different dimensions to consider.
* **Check the weight limit of your stand or mount** . Consider the weight of the new TV compared to your old one. You may need a new wall mount or TV stand if it's significantly heavier.
* **Check your cables** . If it's been a while since you got a new TV, your HDMI cables may be outdated. If you bought a 4K TV and want to connect a current-generation game console, you'll need cables that support[HDMI 2.1](https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-2-0-vs-2-1-5203868) for the best results.
* **Consider transferring your streaming device** . If you're currently using a streaming device like an Apple TV or Fire Stick, consider removing it from the old TV and connecting it to the new one, even if it has built-in streaming capabilities, for the smoothest transition.
* **Get your passwords together** . If you aren't using your old streaming device, have the login information handy for all your streaming services.

## More Tips for Buying a TV

 When buying a new TV, the general rule is that bigger is better, which goes for both the screen's physical size and the resolution. You'll rarely regret buying a too-big TV unless you go too far. For example, purchasing an 85-inch 4K TV for an 80-square-foot bedroom is excessive.

 The main exception to the rule is that 8K is currently overkill, and you're unlikely to regret "settling" for a 4K TV. The highest resolution content you'll likely consume regularly will be 4K video from Blu-rays, game consoles, and streaming services because 8K content isn't widely available yet.  

 FAQ

* How do I know if my TV is 4K?  
 You can check your current TV's maximum resolution by looking up the model number. You can find this either on a sticker on the back of the set or by checking the**Support** (or similar) heading in the TV's settings.
* What is a good refresh rate for a TV?  
[Refresh rate](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984) describes how often a TV screen updates the images it displays. For example, a set with a refresh rate of 120 Hz changes the screen 120 times per second. This level is good for most watching since it's higher than the refresh rate of streaming boxes or players you might plug in. 120 Hz is the minimum you should look for if you're watching movies or playing games for the best picture and animation. However, you will want to be sure you're using at least HDMI 2.1 cables to get the maximum refresh rate.
