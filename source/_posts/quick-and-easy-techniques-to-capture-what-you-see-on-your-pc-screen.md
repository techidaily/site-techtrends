## Quick and Easy Techniques to Capture What You See on Your PC Screen

Close 

###  What to Know

* To capture only the active window, press**Alt** +**PrtScn** .

 This article explains how to take screenshots on a Windows PC. Instructions apply to Windows 7 and later.

##  How to Take a Screenshot 

 The basic way to take a screenshot in Windows is the same way no matter what[ version of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/what-version-of-windows-do-i-have-2624927) you're using, and it's very simple: ​press the **PrtScn**  key on the keyboard.

* **PrtScn:** Press the button once to save a screenshot of the entire screen. If you have multiple monitors connected, a single press of the print screen button will save a screenshot of all the screens in one single image.
* **Alt** +**PrtScn:** Press these buttons at the same time to take a screenshot of a single window that you're focused on. Select the window once to make sure it's in focus, and then press these keys.
* **Win** +**PrtScn:** Using the Windows key with the print screen button (in Windows 8 and newer) will take a screenshot of the whole screen and then save it in the default Pictures folder in a subfolder called Screenshots (e.g.**C:\\Users\\\[user\]\\Pictures\\Screenshots** ).

##  How to Paste or Save a Screenshot 

 The easiest way to save a screenshot is to first paste it into the Microsoft Paint application. It's included with Windows by default.

 You do have other options, like to paste it into Microsoft Word, Photoshop, or any other program that supports images, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll use Paint. The quickest way to open Paint in all versions of Windows is through the Run dialog box.

1. Press **Win** +**R** .
2. Type**mspaint** into the**Run** field, and select**Enter** .

3. With Microsoft Paint open, and the screenshot still saved in the clipboard, use**Ctrl** +**V** to paste it into Paint, or select**Paste** .

 At this point, you may notice that the image you saved looks a bit off. If the image doesn't take up the_entire_  canvas in Paint, it will leave white space around it. To fix this, drag the bottom right corner of the canvas toward the top left of the screen until you reach the corners of your screenshot.

##  Alternatively, Download a Print Screen Program 

 Although Windows works great for basic screenshotting abilities, you can install both free and paid third-party applications for more advanced features like fine-tuning the screenshot by pixel, annotating it before you save it, and easy saving to a predefined location.

 One example of a free print screen tool that's more advanced than the Windows one is[ PrtScr](http://www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/) . Another, [ WinSnap](https://www.ntwind.com/software/winsnap.html) , is good, but the free edition lacks some of the more advanced features of the premium version.
