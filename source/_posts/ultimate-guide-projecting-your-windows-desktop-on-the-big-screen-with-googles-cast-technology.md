##  How to Cast Your PC Desktop

 Casting the entire desktop works well for relatively static items that don't run within a web browser, so it's ideal when presenting a slideshow or some other desktop app. Ensure that your Chromecast and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network, then open Chrome and follow these directions:

1. Select the**three dots** in the upper right corner of Chrome and choose**Save and share** \>**Cast** .

2. Click**Source** and then choose**Cast screen** .

3. Select your Chromecast. After a few seconds, your desktop starts casting.

 Don't see it? You have to[ set up your Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-google-chromecast-5323335) first and it must be on the same Wi-Fi network as your PC.
4. If you have a multi-monitor display setup, you'll be asked to choose the screen you want to cast. Pick one and then select**Share** .  
![A monitor chosen for desktop casting in Google Chrome](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kKQFzlP5JBYVySrIoXa_dTRFZF8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/chromecast-share-entire-screen-cf92f59ad31e425f97a8152172a336f0.png)  
 Your PC desktop will start casting immediately. To turn off casting, select the blue Chromecast icon at the top right of Chrome and choose**Stop** .  
 When you cast the entire desktop, you'll see an option to also share your system audio, which you can keep on or switch off.

##  How to Cast a Chrome Browser Tab

 Don't want to cast the whole screen? Chrome lets you pick a single tab if you'd rather see just that on your TV. This method might be used to show a website on your TV or to display photos or online documents.

 The steps are very similar to the above directions:

1. Open Chrome's**three-dot menu** at the top right and then select**Save and share** \>**Cast** .
2. Select**Source** in the pop-up window and make sure**Cast tab** is selected.
3. Choose your Chromecast from the list to start casting the active tab to your TV.

## Cast Screen vs Cast Tab

 These are your options when using Chromecast with a computer. They might seem similar but there's a big difference, which matters depending on the type of content you want to cast to your TV.

 The screen option casts the whole desktop. This includes the taskbar, Start menu, and any program you open during the casting session. Whether it's Photoshop, another web browser, Microsoft Office, or Notepad — it doesn't matter. Anything you open on your desktop or laptop will display on the TV until you shut off casting.

 The tab option is much more restricted, but that can be better in some situations. The tab you're viewing when you start casting is what will show up on the TV, and nothing else. You can browse around to different websites and as long as you don't close the tab, each website will appear on the TV.

 Both options are great for sharing content with the room or using your TV as a bigger screen, but only for things that don't move much, like text-only apps and websites. What it doesn’t work as well for is video. Well, it depends...

##  Casting Videos From a PC to Chromecast

 Streaming video to a Chromecast works great if you're watching a video on a website that supports casting. This is because the Chromecast will source the stream directly from that website instead of your computer. In other words, it's no longer broadcasting from your tab or screen, but instead directly from the internet, essentially turning your computer into a remote.

 YouTube is one example of a site that can do this, but there are lots of other ones. To check, look for the cast icon somewhere in the video player. On YouTube, it's along the bottom right. Select that button and then choose your Chromecast to watch the video on your TV.
