## Eliminate Your Missing d3dx9_27.dll Error with These Simple Fixes
 The d3dx9\_27.dll file is one of many files that make up DirectX. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows based games, d3dx9\_27.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

 Any of Microsoft's operating systems since Windows 98 may be affected by d3dx9\_27.dll and other DirectX issues. This includes Windows 11 through Windows 2000.

## How to Fix D3dx9\_27.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not, under any circumstances, download d3dx9\_27.dll individually from any DLL download site. There are a number of reasons why[downloading DLLs like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, delete it from wherever you put it and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) , unless you already have since this problem began.  
 The d3dx9\_27.dll error might be a one-time problem, and a simple restart could clear it up completely. It's unlikely this will fix the issue, but restarting is always a good first step.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the d3dx9\_27.dll not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error you're receiving, look for a copy of DirectX on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or other program uses DirectX, the software developers will include an installable copy of it on the setup disc.  
 In some cases, the DirectX version included on the disc will work better with the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something may have happened to the files in the program that work with the d3dx9\_27.dll file, and a reinstallation could solve the problem.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_27.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the steps above haven't worked to solve your issue, try extracting the d3dx9\_27.dll file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations, updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

 D3dx9\_27.dll issues are caused in one way or another by a problem with Microsoft DirectX.

 There are several ways d3dx9\_27.dll related errors might show up on your computer:

* **The file d3dx9\_27.dll was not found**
* **Cannot find d3dx9\_27.dll**
* **The dynamic link library d3dx9\_27.dll could not be found in the specified path \[PATH\]**
* **The file d3dx9\_27.dll is missing**
* **D3DX9\_27.DLL is missing. Replace D3DX9\_27.DLL and try again**
* **Error initializing the application because the file d3dx9\_27.dll was not found**
* **The application failed to start because d3dx9\_27.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem**

 These errors usually appear when a piece of software or video game is started. However, it's more common with video games, and occasionally, these errors will show up after a game is loaded but right before the actually begins.

 In non-game programs, a d3dx9\_27.dll error might show up before certain graphics features are used.

 The error message could apply to any program that utilizes Microsoft DirectX, but again, it's most commonly video games. Here are some common examples of games that might generate this kind of DLL error: _F.E.A.R., The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown, Zoo Tycoon 2, Fable: The Lost Chapters, Age of Empires III, Flight Simulator X, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle For Middle-Earth,_ and_The Godfather_ .

 It's crucial to be aware of the context in which any DLL error occurs so that you're not following irrelevant troubleshooting steps.
