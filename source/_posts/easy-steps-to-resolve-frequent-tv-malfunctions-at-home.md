 At a glance, a TV seems simple. However, modern TVs are complex devices with a wide range of features and settings that can be problematic. This article will teach you how to fix a TV suffering common issues.

## The Causes of Common TV Problems

 A TV can malfunction or appear to malfunction for many reasons, but we can place most problems into a few categories.

* Brightness: The TV is too dark.
* Color: The TV's color is unappealing.
* Aspect ratio: The TV's image looks squashed or stretched.
* Motion: The TV's motion is too smooth or stutters.
* Hardware defect: The TV won't turn on or is physically damaged.

 You can fix the first four issues by changing TV settings. Hardware defects and physical damage, however, will require professional repair.

## How to Fix a TV With a Dark Image

 A TV with a dark image can be, at best, difficult if not impossible to watch. It may not be bright enough to see in a lit room or fail to show detail in dark content. Here's how to fix a TV with a dark image.

1. Turn off the TV's energy-saving features. Look for Energy Star, Eco, Green, or something similar. Energy-saving features limit a TV's brightness.
2. Turn off the TV's Ambient Light Sensor if it has one. An ambient light sensor will limit a TV's brightness depending on how well lit a room is.
3. Increase the TV's Brightness. Most TVs ship with a default brightness setting much lower than the maximum brightness possible.
4. Change the TV's contrast value to be at the middle of the range of settings available.  
 A contrast setting that's too high can be unattractive, so we recommend keeping value towards the middle of the range available.
5. [Change the TV's gamma setting](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-gamma-493590) . Gamma settings are often expressed as numbers. A lower number will provide a brighter image.
6. Factory reset your TV.  
 A factory reset will erase any settings you have saved to the TV.

## How to Fix a TV With Color Issues

 Flip between modes to see if the color is more to your liking.

## How to Fix a TV With a Squashed or Stretched Image

 Nearly all modern TVs have a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, and most content is made with this in mind. However, you may see squashed or stretched content when connecting devices designed for older displays.

1. Change the[TV's aspect ratio](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-aspect-ratio-1846860) mode. One should typically view content formatted for a 16:9 TV in a**Widescreen** or**Wide** picture size mode.  
 However, if you're viewing older 4:3 content, look for a**4:3 Aspect Ratio** or**Normal** picture size setting. It will display the content with black bars on either side, which is the correct way to view 4:3 content on a 16:9 widescreen TV.
2. Change the aspect ratio of the input device connected to your TV. DVD players, Blu-Ray players, game consoles, streaming sticks, and other devices connected to your TV often have an aspect ratio setting.  
 It should default to a setting appropriate to your TV, but, in rare cases, you will need to set it manually.

## How to Fix a TV With Motion Issues

 A modern TV displays various content with different frame rates and uses an onboard processor to smooth motion. Not everyone likes the results, however.

 In general, you should turn off a TV's motion clarity setting if the TV's image appears too smooth.

 Select a less aggressive motion clarity settings if you see halos, blocks, or other issues around fast-moving objects.

 Increase the motion clarity setting if you think the image stutters or has a low frame rate.
