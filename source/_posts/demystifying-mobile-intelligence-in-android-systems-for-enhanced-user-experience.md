## Demystifying Mobile Intelligence in Android Systems for Enhanced User Experience
 Android System Intelligence (ASI) is a core component of the[Android operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887) that’s responsible for a lot of smart features, like providing automatic response options and keeping the screen on as long as the camera detects that you’re looking at it. Since this is a component of the Android OS that performs a lot of useful functions, there’s no need to worry if you notice that it’s running on your phone. You can disable Android System Intelligence if you want, but doing so will cause a lot of features to stop working.

## What Is Android System Intelligence, and Do I Need It?

 Android System Intelligence is built into Android. It supports a variety of smart features and protects your data in the process. Since it requires[system permissions](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-manage-android-app-permissions-4797758) and often passes potentially sensitive information from one place to another, this protection is key. In older versions of Android, it was known as Device Personalization Services, with the new name designed to reflect the fact that it supports smart functions.

 While you don’t technically need System Intelligence for your phone to work on a very basic level, like making phone calls, a lot of features won’t function without it. If you ever use any of these features, then you do need Android System Intelligence. For example, if you shut off System Intelligence, your phone would stop providing automatically generated reply options, the clipboard would stop working correctly, and the search function wouldn't be able to find apps.

## What Features Does Android System Intelligence Support?

 Android System Intelligence supports a wide variety of smart features that leverage[machine learning](https://www.lifewire.com/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning-5112807) to improve your experience. Here are some of the most important features that are enabled by System Intelligence:

* **Attention sensor** : Using input from the front-facing camera, Android System Intelligence can keep your screen on as long as it determines that you are looking at the screen. This prevents it from timing out and shutting off when you’re watching a video but lets the screen turn off if you aren’t watching anymore.
* **Autorotation** : This feature rotates the screen orientation automatically based on the orientation of the phone.
* **Automatic captions** : This feature is capable of[generating live captions for media that doesn’t have captions available](https://www.lifewire.com/live-caption-4778684) .
* **Smart text selection** : Enables targeted actions when you select the text, like long-pressing an address to view directions. It also turns some text into clickable links.
* **Live translation** : Capable of translating text in live conversations and videos.
* **Voice Typing** : Allows you to dictate through Assistant.
* **Now Playing** : Automatically listens for and identifies music around you, and displays information on the lock screen.
* **Notification management** : Inserts useful action buttons into notifications, allowing a notification to open a relevant app or provide necessary information when tapped.
* **Smart clipboard** : Improves the copy and paste system, making it easier to copy information and move it between apps.

## Can Android System Intelligence Cause Problems?
