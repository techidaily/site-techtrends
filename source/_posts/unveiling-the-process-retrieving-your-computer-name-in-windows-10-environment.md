##  Using Command Prompt

 If you like writing and executing commands, there's a [command line](https://howto.techidaily.com/6-solutions-to-fix-error-505-in-google-play-store-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) method you can use to [view your machine's name](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/value-airborne-inventors-budget-friendly-flight-tools-for-2024/).

 To use it, first, [open a Command Prompt window](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-oppo-a78-frp-by-drfone-android/). You can do that by accessing the "Start" menu, searching for "Command Prompt", and selecting the tool in the search results.

![Search for "Command Prompt," then click the first result.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/open-control-panel.png) 

 In Command Prompt, type the `hostname` command and press Enter:

hostname

 This command only retrieves one value, which is your PC name.

![The result of the hostname command.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/10-hostname-command-windows.png) 

 Another command you can use to view your computer's name along with [your network adapter details](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-infinix-note-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) is `ipconfig /all` . Type this command in Command Prompt and hit Enter, and you'll see your machine name next to "Host Name."

![The result of the "ipconfig /all" command.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11-ipconfig-all-command-windows.png) 

 And those are the ways to know what [name your PC goes by](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-apple-iphone-8-sim-lock-by-drfone-ios/) on your network. Very useful!
