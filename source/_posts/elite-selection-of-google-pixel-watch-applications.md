## What You Can Do With Selected Emails

 Anything you can do with a single email, Gmail lets you do with a selection of messages. Here are some actions you can take when you select lots of emails at once:

* **Delete** : To remove the selected emails, click the trashcan icon.
* **Archive** : This icon appears as a box with a small arrow in it. Archiving emails removes those messages from view in your Inbox without deleting them, which is great for tidying up. Once archived, an email will not appear in your inbox, but it can be found through a search or by viewing the All Mail folder.
* **Report spam** : This button uses a stop sign with an exclamation point in its center. Selecting it moves emails to your[Spam](https://www.lifewire.com/what-and-why-spam-email-1173993) folder, and future emails from these senders bypass your Inbox and go to your Spam folder automatically.
* **Move to** : This button has a folder icon on it, and it allows you to move your selected emails into a folder or label.
* **Labels** : This button has an image of a tag on it. It allows you to[assign labels to selected emails](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-organize-and-categorize-messages-with-labels-in-gmail-1171996) .

 The**More** button (the three dots) offers several other options for your selected emails. These include:

* Mark as read
* Mark as unread
* Mark as important
* Mark as not important
* Add star
* Filter messages like these
* Mute
* Forward as attachment

 The Gmail app also lets you select all the emails in the current view, but you can't use the app to highlight_every single message_ . To bulk-select lots of messages at once, tap and hold to select one message, then choose**Select all** .
