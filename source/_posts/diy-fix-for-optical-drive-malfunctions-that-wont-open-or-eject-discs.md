* ESL courses to strengthen English skills.

 What We Don't Like

* The interface can be clunky at times.
* It has a limited vocabulary.

Whether your child wants to learn outside of their curriculum or wishes to practice what they learned in class, Duolingo is an excellent addition to any digital device.

 With over forty languages to choose, your child can practice German, Italian, Spanish, French, or dozens of other languages. If your student is currently enrolled in ESL courses, they can strengthen their English skills from the bottom-up.

## [Photomath](https://www.photomath.net/en/)

![PhotoMatch app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uyeOAz6_K3BrV9cNkNt3TG9c1IE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/PhotoMath-5b4e5413c9e77c001adc04d4.jpg)

 What We Like

* It's great for helping math students who fall behind.
* 2D graph plotting and quick calculations.

 What We Don't Like

* It's somewhat limited depth.
* Doesn't provide much about why an answer is incorrect.

 Mathematics can be one of the most challenging courses for students, with complicated steps that are quickly forgotten after a long school day.

 Especially challenging is that many parents struggle to help their children with subject matter that they haven't been acquainted with for years. Photomath is an excellent solution for struggling mathematicians.

 Children can scan complex or simple math problems, learning how to solve them with step-by-step instructions. A built-in calculator improves the experience, allowing for smart, on-the-fly calculations and 2D graph plotting abilities. Linear equations, logarithms, trigonometry, functions, and basic algebraic expressions are only a few of Photomath's vast capabilities.

* The focus on memorization is ideal for studying.

 What We Don't Like

 What We Don't Like
