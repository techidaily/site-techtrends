## What is Share Play? 

 The PlayStation 5’s Share Play feature allows multiple people to participate in a session, even if they don’t all own the same game. You can use it to spectate, take direct control remotely, or play together cooperatively (in select titles). 

 The PS5 actually has two “share” features. The first is Share Play, which lets you play a game cooperatively with another player or give them full control. Then, you have Screen Share, which lets you stream your game for up to 16 players in a party.

 Share Play has two modes:

* **Visitor Plays as You:** Gives control of the game to the visitor, allowing them to play it remotely. As the host, you still have control of your PS5 and can pause or exit the session by tapping the PlayStation button on your controller.
* **Play With the Visitor:** Play a game with your visitor (this option is limited to games that support multiplayer).

 To host a Share Play session, you must have a[ PlayStation Plus subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-playstation-plus-4772152) . You also need to be friends with the person you invite, so make sure they’re on your Friends List first.

 Other Share Play restrictions include:

* Sessions are limited to one hour. If you exceed that time, the session will automatically end, and you’ll need to start a new one to continue.
* Share Play works with most games, but you'll only be able to play a game together if it supports local multiplayer. For example, you can play_Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 & 2_ together because it has split-screen multiplayer support. However, only the host or visitor would be able to play a single-player title like_Cyberpunk 2077_ .

##  How Do I Enable Game Sharing on PS5? 

 Share Play can be easily confused with PS5 Console Sharing (also known as “Game Share”), but they're different features. Console Sharing give another person access to your digital game library so they can play these titles on their own PSN account. To learn more about Console Sharing, check out[ PlayStation’s official guide](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/account/ps5-console-sharing-offline-play/) .
