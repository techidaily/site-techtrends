## Why the iPhone 16 Pro Is My Top Pick Over the Max in Apple's Latest Lineup - Insights

During Apple's Monday unveiling of the new [iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), one thing was as clear as it was pleasantly surprising: Both Pro models have the same cameras this year.

In past product launches, Apple has saved the best camera features for the higher tier of the lineup, the iPhone Pro Max. However, Apple spun that idea on its head with the launch of the iPhone 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max now feature an upgraded 48MP ultra-wide camera, up from [the previous models' 12MP UW camera](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/). 

They'll also feature a 48MP Fusion lens with a 24mm focal length and 1.78 aperture. The 12MP telephoto lens has a 5x optical zoom with a 120mm focal length and a tetra prism design. The digital zoom goes up to 25x.

The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max also support up to 4K video capture at 120 fps, which is perfect for capturing high-resolution video in slo-mo. This can also be set up for regular video recording. After finishing a video, you can adjust the playback speed between 24, 30, 60, and 120 fps.

I've always [preferred the Pro Max device](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/) for two big reasons: its camera array and larger form factor. Now that Apple's Pro-level phones are growing, the iPhone 16 Pro would likely be my pick for an upgrade. However, [I'm holding off upgrading my iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-16-is-undeniably-great-hardware-but-you-should-still-probably-skip-it/) until next year to benefit my wallet.

The [camera capture button](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-16-model-features-a-new-camera-button-heres-what-it-can-do/) is available on all four iPhone 16 models but leverages more of the Pro's camera features. The camera control lets you switch between different styles by swiping your finger on the touch-sensitive button. You can also adjust settings like aperture, exposure, zoom, style, and focus. 

The Pro cameras also support [Audio Mix](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-5-best-iphone-16-pro-features-that-enthusiasts-will-care-about/), a new feature that pushes the audio capture capabilities with new options, such as isolating audio in-frame to prioritize the audio of what is captured by the camera and deprioritizing the audio behind the camera.

Apple could be giving both Pro models the same camera array to compensate for [delaying the release of Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-delivers-on-hardware-upgrades-but-punts-apple-intelligence-rollout/), its proprietary AI features. Whatever the reason, we'll take it. 

All the new iPhones are available for pre-order now. The [iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) costs $799, the [iPhone 16 Plus](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) costs $899, and the [iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) cost $999 and $1,199, respectively. All orders will begin shipping when general availability begins on September 20\.
