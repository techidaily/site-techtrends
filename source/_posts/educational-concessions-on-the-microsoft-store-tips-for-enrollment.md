## [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)

![Duolingo](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VlBtYrZWFezl-EMISNqYQ1zlRHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Duolingo-b29a7ac4210e44dd9e43aba1cc4e614b.png)

 What We Like

* Easy to use with over 40 languages to learn.
* ESL courses to strengthen English skills.

 What We Don't Like

* The interface can be clunky at times.
* It has a limited vocabulary.

 This popular language-learning app sits at the top of both the[iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355) and[Android](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887) app stores as an excellent solution to strengthen foreign language skills. Whether your child wants to learn outside of their curriculum or wishes to practice what they learned in class, Duolingo is an excellent addition to any digital device.

 With over forty languages to choose, your child can practice German, Italian, Spanish, French, or dozens of other languages. If your student is currently enrolled in ESL courses, they can strengthen their English skills from the bottom-up.

 Unlike other language learning solutions that focus on memorizing vocabulary, Duolingo uses a combination of reading, writing, and speaking exercises to create a more natural learning experience.

 What We Like

* It's great for helping math students who fall behind.
* 2D graph plotting and quick calculations.

 What We Don't Like

* It's somewhat limited depth.
* Doesn't provide much about why an answer is incorrect.

 Mathematics can be one of the most challenging courses for students, with complicated steps that are quickly forgotten after a long school day.

 Especially challenging is that many parents struggle to help their children with subject matter that they haven't been acquainted with for years. Photomath is an excellent solution for struggling mathematicians.

 Children can scan complex or simple math problems, learning how to solve them with step-by-step instructions. A built-in calculator improves the experience, allowing for smart, on-the-fly calculations and 2D graph plotting abilities. Linear equations, logarithms, trigonometry, functions, and basic algebraic expressions are only a few of Photomath's vast capabilities.

 What We Like

* Great music learning app.
* Tools for learning and practicing instruments.

 What We Don't Like

* Voice-overs and instructional design.
* Lacks human touch helpful when learning instruments.

 One school subject that is sadly overlooked is music. If your child is trying to learn a musical instrument and struggling, consider investing in Yousician. This app allows students to practice guitar, bass, piano, or ukulele.

 Students can practice their instruments along with the charts and diagrams that display on the screen. They'll receive real-time feedback when they miss a note or fall out of tune. Included step-by-step video tutorials are available to show your child how to be proficient in a specific skill set.

 Practicing an instrument has never seemed so natural. With different genres of music available, your child can quickly sort out their favorites.

 What We Like

* Digital flashcard platform suitable for all ages.
* The focus on memorization is ideal for studying.

 What We Don't Like

* The ad-supported platform may be distracting.
* User-generated content means some inaccuracies possible.

 While flashcards can be an excellent method for analyzing new material, they use a large amount of paper that is eventually thrown in the trash. With Quizlet Flashcards, your children can learn new topics from existing or self-created sets while also saving trees.

 Quizlet digital flashcards allow students of all ages to practice and excel at various topics using their smartphones. In addition to basic flashcards, Quizlet offers multiple modes to encourage different methods of memorization.

 If your child attends the same class as another student using Quizlet, the two can share flashcards. Those who use the app to study foreign languages can hear keywords spoken to them in 16 languages.

 What We Like

* Parents/guardians can monitor child's education.
* Access to handouts, attendance records, etc.

 What We Don't Like

* Complicated interface.
* Steep learning curve.

 Here's an app that both children and parents can enjoy: PowerSchool Mobile. Many school districts use the PowerSchool system to manage grades and reports. If your child's school is a participant, you can use the mobile app to keep a close eye on your child's educational progress.

 While not every school offers support for the PowerSchool Mobile application, it is worth checking with your child's teacher to see if the option is available. Depending on how a teacher chooses to use the tool in their classroom, you may also have access to handouts, attendance records, school bulletins, and more.

 In addition to keeping up with teacher-provided classroom documents and updates, parents can manage what push and email notifications they receive from the child's school. This simple mobile app can help parents become more involved and aware of their children's school performance.
