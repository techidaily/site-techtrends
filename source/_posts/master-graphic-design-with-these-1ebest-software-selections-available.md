## [ Free Image Editing For Beginners: Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) 

![Paint.NET image editing software on Windows with photo of espresso shot.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xex491QRuVk2dXeZ0DTjJRwJLww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-08-e594b0c10e7d4ecd8a7d7dbd4ca3b7c4.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Has all the basic image editing tools.
* Completely free to download and use.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks the more high-end features from Adobe and Affinity’s apps.

 Paint.NET is a free image editing app for Windows that comes with all of the tools one would need for doing some basic photo editing or graphic creation. In Paint.NET, you can[ adjust levels](https://www.lifewire.com/better-photos-using-paint-net-levels-1702098) , install[ custom brushes](https://www.lifewire.com/use-custom-brushes-in-paint-net-1702091) , and[ use the Magic Wand](https://www.lifewire.com/magic-wand-tool-in-paint-net-1702078) to select areas. Layers, cropping, and resizing are also supported. It’s basically Adobe Photoshop from the early 2000s, but it is free and continually updated with bug fixes and improvements.

 This is not the same as the Paint program included with Windows.

 Paint.NET isn’t for everyone, though. If you’re a pro graphic designer or photographer who needs to manage large numbers of files and requires more advanced features, you’ll likely be better off with an Adobe or Affinity app. For beginner and casual use, though, Paint.NET is ideal.

## [ Industry Standard Graphic Design Tools: Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud) 

![Adobe Photoshop with an AI generated image of a house on a cliff and magic sparkles.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ebI51Cd4ivGOl2Rg5v9mqhPI1UY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-03-59e79d5d07c447ab816251b66f3cf7f6.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Every tool you’ll need for your design project.
* Supported by most industries.

 What We Don't Like

* The recurring monthly subscription is a pain.

 It’s impossible to talk about graphic design apps without mentioning Adobe’s suite of products. Most design professionals have likely used at least a couple of Adobe apps, and many clients and companies require their use. The main four Adobe apps are[ Photoshop](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-photoshop-4688397) for creating and editing images, Illustrator for vector artwork, Lightroom for organizing photos, and InDesign for creating print media, though there are several niche services that many people use.

 Access to these apps is available with a monthly Adobe Creative Cloud subscription of $59.99 (frequently discounted to $35.99). However, individual apps can also be obtained with solo app-specific subscriptions ranging from $4.99 to $19.99 monthly.

## [ Best Subscription-Free Photoshop Alternative: Affinity Photo 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) 

![Affinity Photo 2 graphic design software on Windows with a photo of a city.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/HKxXSa9Phozv7musWDkdWK0teak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-04-21cd778b936440b58829fedcc64800a2.jpg) 

 What We Like

* No subscription required.
* Rivals Photoshop in functionality.

 What We Don't Like

* Not as many plugins as Photoshop.
* Lacks AI tools.

 Affinity Photo 2 is undoubtedly the best alternative to Photoshop. Affinity Photo 2 has all of the primary features found in Photoshop and can be used for any graphic design project you’d typically use. It also supports the importing and exporting of Photoshop's[ PSD file format](https://www.lifewire.com/psd-file-2622194) so there’s no issue using it when working with a client who’s a Photoshop loyalist.

 Affinity Photo 2 lacks some of Photoshop’s newer features, such as one-click object selection and AI asset generation. However, if you don’t need those tools and want to avoid an ongoing Adobe subscription, Affinity Photo 2 is a no-brainer.  

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.

## [ Best Subscription-Free InDesign Alternative: Affinity Publisher 2](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/) 

![Affinity Publisher 2 graphic design software with a magazine template.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wbc5m8pFjj0SjgBpEiu4IOTmIBc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-17-best-graphic-design-software-2024-05-be0de6dad3334e328febaa1e4704c030.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Works faster than InDesign on slower computers.
* No subscription required.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks support for InDesign INDD files.
* Lacks popularity at industry level.

 Affinity Publisher 2 is arguably the best software for graphic designers looking for something like Adobe InDesign that doesn’t need a monthly subscription. Publisher 2 features all of the main functions found in InDesign for creating magazines, books, and marketing materials. It also tends to load and run faster than InDesign too.

 However, unlike Affinity Photo 2, which can be used seamlessly with Photoshop, Affinity Publisher 2 doesn’t support InDesign[ INDD files](https://www.lifewire.com/indd-file-2622754) which can make collaborating with large clients who use InDesign difficult. For smaller teams and freelancers, though, Publisher 2 is worth considering.

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.

 What We Like

* Can be bought without a subscription.
* Large number of file export options.

 What We Don't Like

* Can’t save files in the common AI format.

 Affinity Designer 2 is a solid rival to Adobe Illustrator regarding vector creation software. Designer 2 matches almost all of Illustrator’s features, is less intimidating, and requires fewer system resources.

 The main downside of Affinity Designer 2 is its inability to save projects in Adobe Illustrator's[ AI file format](https://www.lifewire.com/ai-file-4140802) which is incredibly common in the graphic design industry. Finished files can be exported as PNG and a host of other file types, though, so this is only an issue if collaborating with someone who requires AI files.  

 Available on iPad, Mac, and Windows.
