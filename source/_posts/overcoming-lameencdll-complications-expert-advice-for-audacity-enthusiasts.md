## Overcoming lame_enc.dll Complications: Expert Advice for Audacity Enthusiasts
 Depending on what program you're using and what[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) you're running, you could see the lame\_enc.dll error in[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and older versions of Windows as well.

## How to Fix Lame\_enc.dll Errors

 Don't download lame\_enc.dll from any "DLL download site". There are many reasons that[doing so is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . There are a large number of sites offering the lame\_enc.dll for download but there are few legitimate sites that we'd recommend. If you've already downloaded it from one of those sites, remove it immediately and continue with the following steps.

1. Close and reopen the audio program that generated the lame\_enc.dll error. Audacity, or whatever application you're using, might be having a temporary problem that a restart could fix.
2. [Download the latest LAME MP3 encoder package](https://lame.buanzo.org/) . The[ZIP file](https://www.lifewire.com/zip-file-2622675) at this Audacity-sanctioned site contains the latest version of the lame\_enc.dll and related files.  
 The true source location for the LAME MP3 encoder is located at the[LAME site on SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/) but the files here aren't readily usable by your audio program.
3. Extract the DLL file from the ZIP file downloaded in Step 2.

 Windows has built-in abilities to unzip files, but if you prefer a dedicated program, consider using[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or[PeaZip](https://peazip.github.io/) .
4. Copy the lame\_enc.dll file to whatever location your specific audio program requires. Or, install the executable version from Step 2.  
 Some programs don't require the lame\_enc.dll file to reside in particular folders. Audacity, for example, only requires you to tell it where the DLL file is—it doesn't care where.  
 If you're having lame\_enc.dll troubles with Audacity, use its**Edit** \>**Preferences** \>**Libraries** menu to find the_MP3 Export Library_ section. Choose**Locate** and then**Browse** to select the DLL file.

![lame_enc.dll file location in Audacity](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dW88Y2dQ14vs4Ks39ID94-R_Yw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/audacity-mp3-lame-enc-dll-6457c0311ad4416e920303fc5c6dcb83.png)  
 If you've installed the[EXE](https://www.lifewire.com/exe-file-2622732) version for Windows, the DLL file should be stored in the_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Lame For Audacity\\_ folder.  
 This step and screenshot aren't relevant if you're running the latest version of Audacity. Old versions of the program didn't include the LAME MP3 encoder by default, so you could select it manually.
5. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that's generating the DLL error if the above steps didn't work, if they don't apply to your program, or if they're too confusing. Reinstalling the software should replace the DLL file if it's a necessary component that's simply corrupted. This is especially true for Audacity because it includes the LAME MP3 encoder by default (as of[v2.3.2, released in 2019](https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Release%5FNotes%5F2.3.2) ).

## Causes of Lame\_enc.dll Errors

 All lame\_enc.dll errors are caused by either a missing component from the LAME MP3 encoder or some other issue the audio program you're using is having with the LAME MP3 encoder.

 The first two errors below, generated by the[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) software program, are by the far the most common simply because Audacity is the most common application that utilizes the LAME MP3 encoder.

 Before you download and use Audacity, be sure to review its[privacy policy](https://www.audacityteam.org/about/desktop-privacy-notice/) to ensure you’re comfortable with its terms.

 If you're not using that program, your error message will be different and might appear more like the final three examples below.

* **Audacity does not export MP3 files directly but instead uses the freely available LAME library to handle MP3 file encoding. You must obtain lame\_enc.dll separately, by downloading the LAME MP3 encoder, and then locate this file for Audacity. You only need to do this once. Would you like to locate lame\_enc.dll now?**
* **Audacity needs the file lame\_enc.dll to create MP3s.**
* **The LAME\_ENC.DLL File Was Not Found**
* **Error loading lame\_enc.dll**
* **This application failed to start because lame\_enc.dll was not found.**

 Lame\_enc.dll errors sometimes occur when the audio program you're using is first opened. Other times, it will show up when you attempt to save the audio project you're working on as an[MP3 file](https://www.lifewire.com/mp3-file-2622780) , such as when you[use Audacity to convert WAV to MP3](https://www.lifewire.com/audacity-tutorial-how-to-convert-wav-to-mp3-using-lame-2438749) .

 The DLL error message applies to any audio program that utilizes the LAME MP3 encoder.

 Some common software programs that use the LAME MP3 encoder and that might generate lame\_enc.dll errors include Audacity, MuseScore, FFmpeg, VideoLAN, jRipper, CDex, REAPER, LameDropXPd, DVDx, OmniEncoder, LAMEX, RazorLame, Audigrabber, RipTrax, WinAmp, UltraISO, VirtualDJ, TextAlound MP3, and many more.
