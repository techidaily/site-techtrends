## Get Your Free iPhone User Guides Downloaded Here – Every Version Included
 The iPhone doesn't come with a printed user guide, but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist. You just need to know where to look for it.

 All iPhone models are relatively similar when it comes to hardware. It's the software that's different. Apple releases a user guide that covers all models that can run the latest operating system every time a major new version of iOS comes out.

 Apple produces other instructional materials, such as product and safety information and user guides, for each model. Identify which model you have below, and then download the user guide you need.

 We have several guides here at Lifewire that might address the specific problem you're trying to fix. Use the search bar at the top of this page to see if we've already covered the topic before you jump into these user guides.

 The iPhone 15 series features a wireless charging-friendly glass back, rounder edges, and titanium builds for the Pro and Pro Max. (The 15 and 15 Plus retain the aluminum construction.)

[Apple iPhone 15 Pro vs. Pro Max](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-vs-pro-max-8572541)

 The iPhone 14 designs are identical to their iPhone 13 cousins, featuring the wireless charging-friendly glass back, flat edges, and aluminum enclosure. The new models also share the iPhone 13's display size, A15 Bionic Processor, and 5G connectivity.

## iPhone 6 Series (6 and 6S)

 The iPhone 6 line included "S" upgrades and the first "Plus" versions of the phone.

 The iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus are similar. You won't find much in their documents. It's basic legal information. The user guides above are more instructional and better for regular users.

 Like their larger siblings, the iPhone 6 and 6S are essentially the same device with some minor changes.

 Here's more information on this series:

## iPhone 5 Series (5, 5S, and 5C)

 The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone with a screen larger than the 3.5 inches the original models sported. This one has a 4-inch screen. At the same time the phone debuted, Apple introduced its new EarPods, replacing the old earbuds that came with earlier iPhones. Documents here include some quick tips for using the iPhone 5 and instructions for using the EarPods.

 You'll know the iPhone 5S as the first iPhone with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The iPhone 5C can be identified by the brightly colored plastic housing used on its back. It's the same size as the iPhone 5; except for the housing, it's almost the exact same phone.

## iPhone 4 Series (4 and 4S)

 The iPhone 4 became famous—or, more rightly, infamous—for the "death grip" problem with its antenna. You probably won't find mention of that in either of these downloads.

 The iPhone 4S introduced Siri to the world. When this model debuted, it was the only way to get Apple's personal assistant.
