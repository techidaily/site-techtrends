### What to Know

* Visit Apple Support Site > locate product > explain hardware issue > schedule your appointment.
* The Genius Bar is for tech support only. If you want to learn how to use your products, Apple has other in-store options.
* Apple Stores are always so busy that you should make an appointment in advance if you need to get in-person help.

 This article explains how to make an Apple Genius bar appointment, how to describe the problem you're having, and how to reschedule or cancel an appointment.

 You can[use the Apple Store or Apple Support apps for this process](https://www.lifewire.com/make-apple-store-appointment-with-app-1999600) , too. If you're on a computer, follow the below steps to reserve time at the Genius Bar.

## Find Your Product From the Apple Support Site

 The first part of the process for scheduling an Apple Genius Bar appointment is selecting the product you need help with. You have several options for finding your device.

 Genius Bar appointments involve hardware-related issues only. Apple offers online support first before you can seek an in-person appointment option.

1. Begin by going to the[Apple Support website](https://support.apple.com/) .  
![Apple Support website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s7Fe5KixlzedUBQrN4E7LLU4XUY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-ed3284c423f74571b8191dc1201466ed.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the**Get Support** section and select**Start now** .

## Describe Your Problem

 Once you've selected the product you need help with, Apple asks you to detail the issue you're experiencing.

1. A set of common help topics appears for your selected product. Select the category that most closely matches the help you need.  
![Battery & Power selected from a list of hardware issues on the Apple Support website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WYGXlWeRp9pTE3Dk_cKAvjU8_L4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-7a47cc48210944fe970b5a71f1e169b9.jpg)
2. A number of topics within that category will appear. Select the one that best matches your need.  
 If there isn't a match, describe the problem in the**Or, tell us in your own words field** .  
![Power adapter not working as expected selected from a list of battery/power issues on the Apple Support site.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kbJYRrMCzX1ZeQvLhw-FNeYlDAo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/006_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-3878ff72a32d420faadd028e130f9955.jpg)
3. Depending on the category and problem you've selected, a number of follow-up suggestions may appear. If a Genius Bar appointment is an option, move on to the next step.  
 For some topics, the Apple site doesn't offer a Genius Bar appointment as an option. Instead, it suggests a phone call or online chat with Apple support. You'll be prompted with possible ways to solve your problem without going to the Genius Bar. Feel free to try them if you like; they may work and save you a trip.
