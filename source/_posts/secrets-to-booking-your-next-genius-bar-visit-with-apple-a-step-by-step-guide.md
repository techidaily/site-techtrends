## Secrets to Booking Your Next Genius Bar Visit with Apple: A Step-by-Step Guide
### What to Know

* Visit Apple Support Site > locate product > explain hardware issue > schedule your appointment.
* The Genius Bar is for tech support only. If you want to learn how to use your products, Apple has other in-store options.
* Apple Stores are always so busy that you should make an appointment in advance if you need to get in-person help.

 This article explains how to make an Apple Genius bar appointment, how to describe the problem you're having, and how to reschedule or cancel an appointment.

 You can[use the Apple Store or Apple Support apps for this process](https://www.lifewire.com/make-apple-store-appointment-with-app-1999600) , too. If you're on a computer, follow the below steps to reserve time at the Genius Bar.

## Find Your Product From the Apple Support Site

 The first part of the process for scheduling an Apple Genius Bar appointment is selecting the product you need help with. You have several options for finding your device.

 Genius Bar appointments involve hardware-related issues only. Apple offers online support first before you can seek an in-person appointment option.

1. Begin by going to the[Apple Support website](https://support.apple.com/) .  
![Apple Support website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s7Fe5KixlzedUBQrN4E7LLU4XUY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-ed3284c423f74571b8191dc1201466ed.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the**Get Support** section and select**Start now** .  
![Start now button from the Get Support section of the Apple Support website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DoPzReJjYfIi-RspI9HhJta4sjY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-7eb602107ef64ab4abf6ecfd87a03508.jpg)
3. Under**View your products** , select**Sign in** to log in to your Apple ID and view a list of your Apple devices.  
![Apple ID sign-in option from the Apple Support website.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kNnklGJjKqi5-sG2hPrkHstOdsI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-to-make-an-apple-genius-bar-appointment-1999601-a06bf46feb52455fbb0adc278f21431a.jpg)  
 Alternatively, you can enter details about your issue in the**Tell us what's happening** bar. You could also click**Choose a product** under**See all products** to find your model.
