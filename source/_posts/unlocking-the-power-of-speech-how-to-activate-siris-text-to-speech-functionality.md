## How to Make Siri Read Text on iPhone

 Siri can read most text on the screen. The personal voice assistant works on almost all apps while your free hands can work on other things. To make the iPhone read text, go into the Accessibility settings and set up the feature first.

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Accessibilit** y >**Spoken Content** .
2. Enable**Speak Selection** to display a**Speak** button on top of any selected text.
3. Enable**Speak Screen** to hear the entire screen with a two-finger swipe from the top to the bottom of the screen.

4. Select**Speech Controller** and enable the**Show Controller** toggle button. The Speak Controller gives you quick access to the Speak Screen and Speak on Touch features with the help of an overlay on the screen.

5. The other settings on the Spoken Content screen allow you to select**Voices** and adjust the**Speaking Rate** . Use**Pronunciations** to add difficult words to a list and have them voiced precisely.**Typing Feedback** is another accessibility feature that provides voice feedback as it spells each character, entire words, auto-corrections, auto-capitalizations, and typing predictions. Enable this only if necessary.
6. [To use Siri](https://www.lifewire.com/use-siri-on-iphone-12-5084595) , long-press the button on the right side or trigger it with the “Hey Siri” voice command. Say something like “Speak screen” to make Siri read text on the screen. Alternatively, select the text you want Siri to read and then tap**Speak** .

 Enabling**Highlight Content** in the**Spoken Content** settings helps you follow the words as Siri read them. Change the highlight colors if you don’t like the default blue. It’s a handy feature for reviewing documents on the phone.

## How to Make Siri Read Text on macOS

 Spoken content works a bit differently on macOS. It's again an accessibility feature that uses text to speech to read what’s on the screen. On the macOS, it's activated by a keyboard shortcut instead of a direct Siri command.

1. Select**Apple menu** \>**System Preferences.**

4. Leave the other options to their defaults or change them to have words, sentences, or both highlighted as your Mac speaks. Underlined or highlighted sentences mark the spoken sentences to help your eyes track them. Select the pop-up menu for**Highlight content** and choose**Never** to disable highlighted text.

5. Select the**Show controller** pop-up menu to choose the behavior of the controller. By default, the controller will appear with the spoken content and allow you to set the speed. Use the buttons to play, pause, skip ahead or back, or stop the narration. The**turtle** icon on the left slows down the speaking rate while the**rabbit** boosts it.

6. Use the keyboard shortcut**Option** +**Esc** to make macOS read the selected text.

 macOS can read anything on the screen without a selection. But you can make the experience better by selecting the text you want the voice to read aloud. Also, to make your reading more productive with Siri, use the**Reader View** in browsers like Safari and Firefox to clear the clutter before you hit the keyboard shortcut for Spoken Content. On Chrome, macOS won't be able to read text unless you select it.

 FAQ

* How do I get Siri to read my text messages?  
 To have Siri read your text messages out loud for you, activate Siri by pressing the**Home** button (if your iPhone has one) or by holding down the**Side** button (for devices with Face ID and no Home button). Say something like, "Check my messages," "Do I have any messages?" or "Read my messages." You can also say, "Read my latest message" to hear your most recent message.
* How do I get Siri to read my text messages automatically as I receive them?  
 To have Siri read your text messages automatically, you'll need to be wearing second-generation AirPods, AirPods Pro, Powerbeats Pro, or Beats Solo Pro headphones. To set up the feature, go to your iPhone's Settings, then tap**Notifications** and toggle on**Announce Messages with Siri** . When you get a new message, Siri will make a sound, then read who the message is from and the message's contents.
