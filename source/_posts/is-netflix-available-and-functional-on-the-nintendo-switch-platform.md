###  What to Know

* Netflix isn't currently available for the Switch, but it might be in the future.
* You can watch Hulu, YouTube, and Funimation on your Switch. Download the apps from the Nintendo eShop.

 The Nintendo Switch has a lot going for it. Its portability, online capabilities, enormous library of games, and low price point have made it one of the best-selling consoles in the world.

 However, despite all of this, there's one glaring omission most fans think should be addressed: there's no Netflix for Switch.

##  Nintendo Switch and Netflix 

 The streaming service is painfully absent from the platform. That's not to say the service will never come to the Nintendo Switch. In an interview with Fox News, Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo's then-COO, said the company wanted to keep the focus on the games on the platform. 

 Unfortunately, the interview took place in June of 2018\. In the years since, there has been no confirmation Netflix will appear on the Nintendo Switch anytime soon, but that doesn't stop the rumor mill from turning.

## Netflix Pulled From Wii 

 One of the foremost pieces of news Netflix might be coming to the Switch is that the Wii lost support for the majority of its streaming services in early 2019\. Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and YouTube no longer work on Nintendo's old platform.

 Nintendo shut down all network services for the Wii, which has caused other companies to pull their services. But widespread support for those services results in more profit for those companies, so the decision has led many people to speculate all of the streaming services will soon appear on the Switch.

##  Could Netflix Work on Nintendo Switch? 

 There's no question the console is capable of handling the resolution. Undocked, the Nintendo Switch runs at 720p resolution at up to 60 frames per second, depending on the game. While docked, the Switch can reach 1080p resolution and up to 60 frames per second.

 So is Netflix a possibility on the Nintendo Switch? Absolutely. With[ Hulu for Nintendo Switch](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-hulu-on-nintendo-switch-4584598) and YouTube already on the platform, there's little doubt that Netflix will eventually join them. The streaming service might be the perfect fit to tide gamers over in-between big game releases.

##  Streaming Services That Are on Switch 

 You can watch Hulu, YouTube, and Funimation on your Switch. YouTube is free; the other two do require paid memberships.

Once in the eShop, use the search function to find the app you want and click Free Download. You'll be asked to confirm your purchase; just click Free Download again and the app will download.

 After that, you'll need to sign up as a member if you're trying to use a paid membership service.
