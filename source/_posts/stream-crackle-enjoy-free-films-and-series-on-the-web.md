 Movies at Crackle are organized into genres to help you find thrillers,[ comedies](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-comedy-movies-online-1357448) , Crackle Originals,[ action movies](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-action-movies-online-1357447) , dramas, crime movies,[ horror films](https://www.lifewire.com/where-to-watch-free-horror-movies-online-legally-1357650) , and more. You can sort the free movies alphabetically or by recently added so you can check back as often as you want to see what's new.

![A list of free TV shows at Crackle](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aQCNQivnlPAID4xHbNh6lA33h-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/crackle-free-tv-shows-8669ee7f2deb4a948f1f11823f3a65a6.png) 

 Like the movies section, the TV shows you can find here include full episodes, clips, and trailers, including original Crackle series that you can't find anywhere else.

 Crackle keeps videos during a particular time frame and then removes them. This means if you watch part of a movie one day, it's quite possible it could be gone the next before you can finish it. While this isn't ideal, it's still fine for most people since you probably usually watch a movie from beginning to end. Plus, the movies are free, so it's hard to complain.

 If you ever struggle to find something new to watch for free on Crackle, consider trying a different free movie streaming service like[ Pluto TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-pluto-tv-4774389) ,[ Freevee](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-amazon-freevee-7557868) , or[ YouTube](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-s-free-streaming-movies-and-tv-shows-1357439) .

## The Ads Are Worth It

 Because Crackle is free, it uses advertising in both movies and TV shows. One appears at the beginning of the video and then more will appear as you watch. The shorter the video, the fewer advertisements you’ll see, which seems appropriate.

 For example, a 20-minute episode of a TV show might have three advertisements whereas a movie that’s an hour and a half may have as many as nine.

 You can clearly see where the advertisements are in a video. If you put your mouse into the video player and attempt to fast-forward, you’ll notice short yellow lines that indicate advertisements. It's fortunate these are there so you know how far you can fast-forward the video without having to watch another ad.

 Advertisements might tend to be longer than you'd expect. As you skip forward in the video, multiple ads might play back to back. In these circumstances, the ads might last a total of a minute, so they're still tolerable.

##  Video Quality and Player Options

 The video quality for movies and shows on Crackle is decent but not great as you might experience on other websites like[ Tubi](https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-tubi-tv-1357455) . If viewing movies and TV shows on a very large, high-definition screen, this relatively low quality will surely be noticed. However, the movies we tested seemed about as clear as a regular DVD on a normal computer screen.

 As for buffering, we had absolutely no hiccups or stalls when watching several TV shows and movies. From the moment a video started to the point that an advertisement would show, there were no delays due to buffering. There were also no delays when starting a video midway—it would begin to play just moments later from wherever it was clicked.

 We've seen lots of comments about how Crackle's videos are too hard to watch because they take too long to buffer. This wasn't our experience, but whether it's yours depends entirely on your own network bandwidth and computer speed.  

 We also like that Crackle's movies and TV shows can be displayed in full-screen mode to get that theater-like experience at home.

 Below the video is an**Add to Watchlist** button, video description, cast list, and other movies you might like. If you're watching a series, you'll see links to other seasons (if there are any).
