## Resolve the Windows N11 Network Card Error: Essential Steps for Restoring Your Missing Driver

If the network adapter driver is missing, outdated or compatible, it can cause connection problems. After you upgraded to Windows 10, if your internet doesn’t work properly, it’s possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows. Update the network adapter driver to fix the problem.

 You can check if there is a yellow mark next to network device name in[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Under Network adapters, if you see a yellow mark, the network driver has problems.

 You can use Windows to check if an updated driver is available.

Follow these steps:

 1\. Go to Device Manager and expand category **Network adapters** .
 2\. Right-click on the network device name, and then select **Driver Update Software…**

 The above steps above may resolve the problem, but if they not, try to update the drivers using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Note you need to have access to internet to run Driver Easy.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
