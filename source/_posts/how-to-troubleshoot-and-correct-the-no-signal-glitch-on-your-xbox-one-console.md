## How To Troubleshoot and Correct the 'No Signal' Glitch on Your Xbox One Console

Close 

 The[ Xbox One](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291) "No Signal" error refers to when a TV won’t display an Xbox One (or One S or One X) console’s signal even though both the television and console are turned on, and all of the proper cables are connected. This article explains why this happens and what you can do to get it all working again.

##  Causes for an Xbox One HDMI Not Working 

 An Xbox One "No Signal Detected" type of error can often be caused by a minor glitch in the console’s hardware or operating system after an update.

 If you encounter an Xbox One[ HDMI](https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337) issue, the cause might come down to basic human error when connecting the cables to the correct ports.

 These solutions apply to the Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X video game consoles.

##  How to Fix Xbox One 'No Signal' Errors 

 Here are all of the best, and proven, solutions for when your TV won’t detect your Xbox One console. Each fix is listed by difficulty and it’s recommended to work through them in order.

1. Make sure your console is turned on. Is your Xbox One turned on? Sometimes the Xbox’s wireless controllers can disconnect from the console and turn themselves on when you push the Xbox logo button. Check to see if the Xbox logo on the Xbox One console is lit up. If it’s not, press it to manually power on your console.  
 If your wireless Xbox controllers aren’t turning on, they may need recharging or a new battery.
2. [ Check the HDMI inputs](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hdmi-connection-problems-1846811) . Many televisions have numerous HDMI ports for Blu-ray players, video game consoles, and other media devices and it can be easy to get them mixed up. It can also be easy to accidentally switch to the incorrect HDMI channel if you bump or drop your TV remote. Try cycling through the different HDMI sources to see if you’re just on the wrong channel.  
 You may need to wait several seconds after switching HDMI inputs for the Xbox One signal to appear.
3. Check the HDMI cable and connections. The HDMI cable may have become disconnected from the rear of your Xbox One console or the TV. Take a look to see if it’s loose, and firmly push each end into its respective port.

 Make sure that the HDMI cable is in the HDMI-OUT port on the Xbox One console.
4. Try a different HDMI port. It’s entirely possible that an HDMI port on your TV could be broken or damaged. If you have additional HDMI ports on your television model, try plugging the HDMI cable into each of them to see if they work.
5. Check the Xbox One power brick. If you have an original Xbox One model, not an Xbox One S or Xbox One X, you likely would have noticed the external power brick that connects the console to the power socket on your wall. The[ LED light](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820) on the brick should be white if it’s working properly. If it’s orange or red, disconnect the brick from your console and your wall, wait five minutes, plug it in again, and then turn your Xbox One on as per usual.
6. [ Power cycle your Xbox One console](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-your-xbox-series-x-or-s-5085288) . A basic power cycle or hard reset can fix a massive number of Xbox One errors and bugs, and it only takes a minute or two to complete.
7. Clean your Xbox One console. Dust can build up very quickly in Xbox consoles near the air vents. This can cause overheating and problems such as the "No Signal Detected" error. If you have one, use an air gun to blast the dust out of the way. An everyday vacuum cleaner can also work.
8. Launch your Xbox One in low-resolution mode. Press the**Power** button for 10 seconds until you hear a beep, wait 30 seconds, then press the**Power** and**Eject** buttons together for 15 seconds or until you hear another beep. Your Xbox One will now power on with its lowest possible resolution settings. This may bypass whatever glitch was giving you the "No Signal" error.  
 If you're able to enter low-resolution mode, go to**Profile & system** \>**Settings** \>**General** \>**TV & display options** to experiment with higher resolutions and see which setting works best with your TV.
9. Try another TV. If you have another television, try connecting your console to it to see if it also gives you an Xbox One "No Signal Detected" error. If it doesn’t, your original TV may be damaged. If it does, it’s likely that your Xbox One console may be damaged and in need of repair.
10. Get your Xbox console repaired or replaced. As a last resort, you may be able to get Microsoft to repair or even replace your Xbox One console for free if your warrantee is still valid. You can check if your console is still eligible for repair or replacement on the[ official Xbox Support website](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/hardware-network/warranty-service/getting-your-product-serviced) .
