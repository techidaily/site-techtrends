## Apple Discontinues FineWoven Accessories, Introduces New Beats Case Collection - Insights

Last year, Apple introduced its FineWoven brand of cases and accessories, which received backlash because they easily accumulated scratches and lint, lacked a premium feel, and still had steep price tags. Now, it seems Apple listened to user feedback when designing the iPhone 16 lineup of accessories.

On Monday, Apple held its ["Glowtime" launch event,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-iphone-16-event-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-ai-more/) unveiling its latest hardware, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple AirPods 4, and new accessories. But no FineWoven accessories were launched for the new products. 

Now, nearly all FineWoven accessory listings have been removed from the Apple Store. The only ones remaining are the [iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMA6Y4ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-dark-green%3Ffnode%3Df3cb1fed62077a73f300189ec3df066893496cde6ac82a182c58b2daed7a7125bb686189f2eb8f426326edd427855bf711e8bc8817a3dc4096fcc9fa8df2dfdd6b394ec9e20003b3b5f0e4f672ed2efc7555067b96d4ac69789312d25da21d47&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) for $59, and [AirTag FineWoven Key Ring](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMA7J4ZM%2FA%2Fairtag-finewoven-key-ring-dark-green%3Ffnode%3D6691bcb51f5eb21489729fe1ad2aff3b0d29741635422fd208f84083fff22a00f74fb57cde75c5121737d4ea2a97d50cdf3ca70fb195d2c89665f4944338a4e21a9a3cd89bea07e45261050b7557a7afcde48e4f4c2305575a8f17d59e388242&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) for $35\.

Instead, Beats, which is owned by Apple, [released](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240908177203/en/Beats-introduces-new-line-of-cases-with-MagSafe-and-Camera-Control-support-for-the-iPhone-16-lineup) a [new line of iPhone cases](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMCFM4LL%2FA%2Fbeats-iphone-16-pro-case-with-magsafe-summit-stone&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) made of soft microfiber material. These cases support MagSafe and Camera Control, the iPhone's new side button with touch-capacitive sensors that users can tap and swipe to control the camera.

"We're delighted to introduce the first iPhone case designed by Beats," said Oliver Schusser, Apple VP of Apple Music and Beats, in the [release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240908177203/en/Beats-introduces-new-line-of-cases-with-MagSafe-and-Camera-Control-support-for-the-iPhone-16-lineup). "Beats has always been synonymous with distinctive style and vibrant colors, and our new cases are the perfect way to accessorize the new iPhone 16 lineup."

Beats iPhone 16 cases in Midnight Black, Summit Stone, Riptide Blue, and Sunset Purple.

The case has a hard back with flexible sidewalls, which Beats claims will optimize shock absorption. Interestingly, the description also specifies that the outer surface is finished with a "glossy scratch-resistant coating," hoping to assure users that they will not experience the same woes as the FineWoven cases.
