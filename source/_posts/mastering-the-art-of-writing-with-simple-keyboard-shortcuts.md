## Capturing a Scan From a Printer on a Windows PC

 Your printer model may come with software including not only its[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) but also a suite of programs to use all the device's functionality. If this is the case, then within those programs there's also likely a scanning program.

 But if your model didn't come with such software, or you prefer to use in-built OS functions when possible, these instructions are for you. Take the following steps to capture your scan using tools included with a standard Windows installation.

1. Open the Start Menu, and search for the**Scan** app.
2. Alternately, press**Win** +**x** to call the[Power User Menu](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-power-user-menu-2625968) .

3. Select**Settings** .
4. Select**Devices** from the main Settings screen.

![The Windows 10 Scan App with the Scan button highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WLr6RpHDDLddotjF9KKk8SDNUEo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ClickScan-c4149a12b3204f6aaba63680ccbfd6b7.jpg)  
 The Scan app's**Source** setting dictates if it will scan from the device's document feeder (if there is one), or from the flatbed. Unless you know you need to change it, it's a good idea to leave this set on**Auto** . Document feeders typically have a lever to detect if there are pages inside, and leaving this set to**Auto** will scan from the feeder if there’s something loaded, and the flatbed otherwise. Note that when scanning with the flatbed, you'll need to scan one page at a time.  
 Your scan will automatically be saved in the**Scans** sub-directory of your standard**Pictures** folder. It will be saved in PNG format by default and named "Scan" appended with a date stamp (e.g. Scan\_20210614.PNG).
