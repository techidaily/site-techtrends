##### Selected MVPs will proactively engage with community to accelerate awareness and ROI with ABBYY solutions

ABBYY, a leading provider of purpose-built AI for intelligent automation, today launched the ABBYY Most Valuable Professional (MVP) program highlighting inaugural members of its technical community. The ABBYY MVP program awards the title of MVP to developers and technical users who demonstrate exceptional proficiency in ABBYY AI and significant contribution to the ABBYY community, recognizing them for innovative use of AI technologies and their efforts to share their expertise with others. ABBYY MVPs are go-to individuals for insights and feedback, driving successful adoption and value from ABBYY solutions.

Becoming an [ABBYY MVP](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) yields many exclusive opportunities for continuous innovation and professional connection, both remote and in-person. While benefits will continuously evolve and expand, initial benefits include industry-wide recognition, exclusive access to the ABBYY product roadmap, opportunities to feature case studies and the chance to appear on the [AI Pulse Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcawcg-HXtXeE7L%5FeP5yIE8vg64jhaUXj) as a guest speaker.

Inaugural members of the ABBYY MVP program include [Andrew Pett](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrew-pett-b949883) of Engeneum Limited, [Shivam Ghelani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivghelani/) of Extra Technology LTD, [Travis Spangler](http://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-spangler-34625060) of Naviant, Inc., and [Vivek Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-kumar-a605233a/) of Proservartner Services LTD, as well as four professionals from ABBYY.

I joined the ABBYY MVP program to leverage cutting-edge AI and intelligent automation technologies, enhancing my ability to deliver transformative solutions.

By integrating ABBYY's advanced tools and utilizing this program’s access to others within the ABBYY community, I will be enabled to provide clients with unparalleled insights and operational excellence. Clients and partners throughout the globe will substantially benefit from the ABBYY MVP ecosystem and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.
