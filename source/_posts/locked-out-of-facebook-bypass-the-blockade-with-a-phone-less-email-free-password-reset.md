## Open a Pages File Using iCloud

 You don’t have to own an iPhone to have an[iCloud account](https://www.lifewire.com/icloud-faq-1999497) . Apple offers its cloud service for free, giving you a way not only to open a Pages document but edit it online or download it as a Microsoft Word or PDF file. It's is an excellent option if you anticipate receiving additional Pages files.

1. Visit the[iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) site and sign in with your username and password.
2. Select **Pages** from the grid of apps.

8. Follow the subsequent prompts to download the Pages file and open it with the application of your choice. For example, use a[PDF reader](https://www.lifewire.com/free-pdf-readers-1356652) for that format, or a word processor if you downloaded it as a[DOCX](https://www.lifewire.com/docx-file-2620750) file.

## Convert a Pages File to Word or PDF Online

 If you don’t have an iCloud account and prefer not to create one, you can convert the Pages document to a different file type online. There are many[free document file converters](https://www.lifewire.com/free-document-converter-software-programs-2622864) to pick from, but not all of them support Pages files. We'll use CloudConvert for this example, but[Zamzar](https://www.lifewire.com/zamzar-review-2622862) is another one we recommend.

1. Open CloudConvert's[Pages to Word](https://cloudconvert.com/pages-to-doc) or[Pages to PDF](https://cloudconvert.com/pages-to-pdf) page.
2. Select the arrow next to**Select File** and choose **From my Computer** .
