## Precise Instructions to Overcome a 500-Level System Fault
 The 500 Internal Server Error is a very general HTTP status code that means something has gone wrong on the website's server, but the server couldn't be more specific on what the exact problem is.

## How to Fix a 500 Error

 Because the 500 Internal Server Error is a server-side error, the problem probably isn't with your computer or internet connection but instead with the website's server. While not probable, there may be something wrong on your end, in which case here are some things you can try:

 Are you the web manager? Further down this page is some better advice if you're seeing the error on one or more of your pages.

1. Reload the page. You can do that by selecting the refresh/reload button, pressing**F5**  or**Ctrl** +**R** , or trying the URL again from the address bar.  
 Even if the 500 Internal Server Error is a problem on the web server, the issue might be temporary. Trying the page again will often be successful.  
 If the message appears during the checkout process at an online merchant, duplicate attempts to check out may end up creating multiple orders and multiple charges! Most merchants have automatic protections from these kinds of actions, but it's still something to keep in mind.
2. [Clear your browser's cache](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980) . If there's a problem with the cached version of the page you're viewing, it could be causing HTTP 500 issues.  
 Caching issues don't often cause internal Server Errors but we have, on occasion, seen the error go away after clearing the cache. It's such an easy and harmless thing to try, so don't skip it.
3. [Delete your browser's cookies](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-cookies-2617981) . You can correct some 500 Internal Server Error issues by deleting the cookies associated with the site on which you're getting the error.  
 After removing the cookie(s), restart the browser and try again.
4. [Troubleshoot as a 504 Gateway Timeout error instead](https://www.lifewire.com/504-gateway-timeout-error-explained-2622941) . It's not very common, but some servers produce a 500 Internal Server Error when in reality, 504 Gateway Timeout is a more appropriate message based on the cause of the problem.
5. Contact the website. There's a good chance the site's administrators already know about this error, but if you suspect they don't, letting them know helps both you and them (and everyone else).  
 Most sites have support-based social network accounts, and a few even have email and phone numbers.  
 If it looks like the site is down entirely and you can't find a way to report the 500 Internal Server Error message to the website, it might help your sanity to keep up with the outage on social media. You can usually search for_#websitedown_ , as in[#gmaildown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gmaildown?lang=en) or[#facebookdown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/facebookdown?lang=en) .
6. Come back later. Unfortunately, at this point, the 500 Internal Server Error is no doubt a problem outside of your control that will eventually get fixed by someone else.  
 If the error appears at checkout during a purchase, it might help to realize that sales are probably being disrupted—usually a great incentive for the store to fix the issue quickly.

## Fixing 500 Internal Server Error Problems on Your Own Site

 A 500 Internal Server Error on your website requires an entirely different course of action. Because most 500 errors are server-side, it's likely your problem to fix if it's your website.

1. There are lots of reasons why your site might be serving a 500 Error to your users, but these are the most common:  
   * **A Permissions Error.** In most cases, the error is due to an incorrect permission on one or more files or folders. In most of_those_ cases, an incorrect permission on a[PHP](https://www.lifewire.com/php-file-4138559) and[CGI](https://www.lifewire.com/cgi-file-2620227) script is to blame. These should usually be set at 0755 (-rwxr-xr-x).  
   * **A PHP Timeout.** If your script connects to external resources and those resources time out, an HTTP 500 error can occur. Timeout rules, or better error handling in your script, should help if this is the cause of the 500 error.  
   * **A Coding Error in .htaccess.** While not as common, check that your site's[.htaccess file](https://www.lifewire.com/htaccess-file-2621687) is properly structured.
2. If you're running[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/) ,[Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) , or another content management or CMS system, search their support centers for more specific help troubleshooting a 500 Internal Server Error. If you're not using an off-the-shelf content management tool, your web hosting provider, like[InMotion](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/error-numbers/500-internal-server-error/) ,[DreamHost](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216475397-Troubleshooting-a-single-site-s-connection) ,[IONOS (1&1)](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/http-error-500-internal-server-error/) , etc., probably has some 500 Error help that might be more specific to your situation.

## Ways You Might See an Internal Server Error

 When Google services, like Gmail, are experiencing the error, they often report a_Temporary Error (500)_ , or simply_500_ . This error message might be seen in many ways because each website is allowed to customize the message.

 Here are several common ways that you might see the HTTP 500 error wording:

* 500 Internal Server Error
* HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error
* HTTP Error 500
* 500\. That's an error
* Temporary Error (500)
* Internal Server Error
* HTTP 500 Internal Error
* 500 Error

 Since a 500 Internal Server Error is generated by the website you're visiting, you could see one in_any_ browser in_any_ operating system, even on your smartphone. Most of the time, it displays inside the browser window, just as web pages do.

 When Windows Update is involved, it appears as a_WU\_E\_PT\_HTTP\_STATUS\_SERVER\_ERROR_ message or_0x8024401F_ error.

 If the website that reports the 500 error is running Microsoft IIS, you might get a more specific message:

## Other Errors Like the HTTP 500

 Many browser error messages are similar to the 500 Internal Server Error message because they're all server-side errors, like[502 Bad Gateway](https://www.lifewire.com/502-bad-gateway-error-explained-2622939) ,[503 Service Unavailable](https://www.lifewire.com/503-service-unavailable-explained-2622940) , and[504 Gateway Timeout](https://www.lifewire.com/504-gateway-timeout-error-explained-2622941) . Many client-side HTTP status codes also exist, like the popular[404 Not Found error](https://www.lifewire.com/404-not-found-error-explained-2622936) , among others.

## What Causes an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

 Most of the time, this error appears when there's an issue with the page or site's programming, but there's certainly a chance that the problem is on your end. Those problems could be caused by cache or cookie errors in a browser.

 More specific information about the cause of a particular HTTP 500 error is often provided when it occurs on a server using Microsoft IIS software. For example, look for numbers after _500_ , as in **HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error** , which means **Configuration data is invalid** .
