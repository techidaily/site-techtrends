## Add a Network Printer in Windows

 All modern versions of Windows include a[printer-sharing feature that allows a computer to share its printer](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-file-and-printer-sharing-818221) . This method requires the printer to be on and connected to a networked computer.

1. [Enable file and printer sharing](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-file-and-printer-sharing-818221) . This option is buried in some advanced sharing settings, which you can access through Settings or Control Panel, depending on your Windows version.

2. Open the Start menu and search for**printers** . Choose**Printers & scanners** from the list, or**Devices and Printers** in some versions of Windows.

3. Select the printer you want to share and then go to**Printer properties** \>**Sharing** . Select the**Share this printer** check box.  
![Printer settings in Windows with the Sharing tab and Share checkbox highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FMznevOCPfflR4PrsuJo27zeQYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003-networking-a-printer-817579-479b4bf125d54847b2c6265deb2945e4.jpg)
4. Change the share name if you want, then press**OK** to save.

[When another computer adds the printer](https://www.lifewire.com/add-printer-to-windows-11-5194315) , they will need the right printer driver. This should be a seamless process as long as the PC that shared the printer has the correct drivers installed. If other computers can't print to the shared printer, they should visit the manufacturer's website to[get the correct printer drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-a-printer-driver-4781671) .

## Network Printers Using Non-Windows Devices

 Operating systems other than Windows incorporate slightly different methods to support network printing:

* Current versions of macOS can automatically detect and add certain kinds of printers, with manual configuration options in the Print & Scanners section of System Settings. Older versions of Mac OS X provided a utility called Print Center for setting up printers connected to Mac computers.
* [AirPrint](https://www.lifewire.com/things-to-know-about-airprint-iphone-2000750) enables wireless printing abilities on Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad. AirPrint support requires using a specially manufactured printer of the same brand.
* Different Unix and Linux distributions provide generic support for network printing. User interface details differ, but most are based on a common Unix printing mechanism called CUPS_._

## Using Wireless Printers on a Network

 Network printers for home and small businesses look similar to other types. However, these printers feature other connection methods like an[Ethernet port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546) or built-in[Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) .

 For Ethernet-capable printers, connect the printer directly to the[router](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-router-2618162) with an Ethernet cable. For Wi-Fi-capable printers,[connect the printer to Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-printer-to-wifi-4767485) so that any device on the network can see it. Wi-Fi printers can typically be configured through a screen on the front of the printer. The screen also displays error messages that are helpful in troubleshooting problems.

 When a printer is available over the network, any device that can communicate with it can add the printer. There's no need to go through the steps above to share it. For example, once your Wi-Fi printer is connected to the network,[this is how it works to add that printer to Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/add-printer-to-windows-11-5194315) .

 Some home printers offer[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) network capability, usually enabled by an attached adapter rather than being built-in. Bluetooth printers are designed to support general-purpose printing from cell phones. Because it is a short-range wireless protocol, phones running Bluetooth must be placed close to the printer to work.

## Wireless Printer Adapters

 Many older printers don't support Wi-Fi, but that doesn't mean you need to buy a new printer just to use it on your network. A wireless printer adapter is a special-purpose gadget that bridges these printers to a wireless[home network](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-build-and-maintain-the-best-home-network-4097862) . To use one, attach the printer to the adapter and then connect that to the router.
