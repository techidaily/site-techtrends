## [ The Little Mermaid (2023): Best Adventure of Self-Discovery](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5971474/) 

![Halle Bailey portraying the Little Mermaid talking to Sebastian, the talking crab.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4iyvhoVhQqd7EXLxfpEwub-sQVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LittleMermaid2023-ab184200dea44c86a122c2db1e34379d.jpg) 

**IMDB Rating** : 7.2/10

**Genre** : Adventure, Family, Fantasy

**Starring** : Halle Bailey, Jonah Hauer-King, Melissa McCarthy

**Director** : Rob Marshall

**Rating** : PG

**Runtime** : 2 hours, 15 minutes

 The age-old story of Ariel is remade for the 2020s with the same themes of following your heart . . . and the repercussions that can have. Even in this retelling, the story is heartwarming and attempts to portray today's social realities with a Black mermaid tackling the world above the sea.

 Some of the scenes are a bit rough for very young children but no more so than previous iterations of the movie. Halle Bailey does a good job playing the curious and headstrong young mermaid; the movie is still a fun romp for anyone who loves talking animals, smart young women, and timeless tales.

**Genre** : Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Starring** : Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad

**Directors** : Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee

**Rating:** PG

**Runtime** : 1 hour, 42 minutes

_Frozen_ was a mega-hit for Disney due to its ground-breaking digital animation, chart-topping songs, and strong messaging. Adult viewers may laugh at some noticeable plot holes and corny character moments. However, the powerful theme of sisterly love and wintery visuals will keep everyone entertained.

 If you've already seen the original,_Frozen 2_ is also available on Disney+. The sequel successfully adds depth to the original characters while achieving phenomenal world-building in the process. What sets it apart are its scenes that show how to navigate stressful, even traumatic, situations even when all hope is lost. This movie is a sequel that easily surpasses its predecessor and boasts a maturity that’s equally surprising and welcome.

**Director** : Peter Sohn

**Rating** : PG

**Runtime** : 1 hour, 46 minutes

 Set in Element City, we meet Ember (a fire element) and Wade (a water element) and watch as their relationship sparks and fizzles.  

 This is a pretty standard Pixar movie, and while some may ho-hum it, kids will love the colors and the ways the elements look, move about, and interact. There are a few tense moments, but no kids should be too frightened. This is a love story; even some jaded parents might see how opposites can be a perfect fit.

 Young Wendy (Ever Anderson) joins Peter Pan (Alexander Molony) and his fairy friend Tinker Bell (Yara Shahidi) for a journey through Neverland. In this world, kids never grow up and have no worries, save for the ferocious pirate Captain Hook (Jude Law).   

 Given the insane number of Peter Pan adaptations over the years, it's unlikely that anyone in your home isn't familiar with the story, but it's nice to get a new big-budget retelling of a classic tale. You can also watch the original animated film.

**Rating** : PG

**Runtime** : 1 hour, 48 minutes

_Zootopia_ , named_Zootropolis_ in several regions, is a profound Disney kids movie that explores racism through the lens of a world of animals where humans never existed. To the film’s credit,_Zootopia_ doesn’t speak down to viewers nor oversimplify the discussion and impressively manages to cover the various nuances surrounding race rather well, all within a beautifully animated, thoroughly entertaining, and age-appropriate package.

 Ginnifer Goodwin from_Once Upon A Time_ (also on Disney+) and Jason Bateman voice the two leads and are backed up by an impressive supporting cast of actors ranging from talents such as Idris Elba and Bonnie Hunt to Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira.
