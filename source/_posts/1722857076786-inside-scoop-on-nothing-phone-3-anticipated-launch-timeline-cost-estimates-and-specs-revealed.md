 Nothing is having a banner year with the release of the Nothing Ear (a) and the Nothing Phone 2a—and shows no signs of losing that momentum: The buzzed-about Nothing Phone 3 is expected to arrive next year. Details are hard to come by, but here’s what we anticipate so far about the debut of this next-gen phone.

## When Will the Nothing Phone 3 Be Released?

[9to5Google reports](https://9to5google.com/2024/06/05/nothing-phone-3-2025-ai/) that Nothing confirmed over email that it won't be releasing its next flagship until 2025.

 Given that hint, we suspect a July 2025 reveal based on prior Nothing phone flagship releases: The Nothing Phone 1 arrived in July 2022, followed by the Nothing Phone 2 in July 2023.

### Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

We're betting on a July 2025 release date for the Nothing Phone 3.

## Nothing Phone 3 Price Rumors

 Since release and ordering details are slim to none, pricing information is still forthcoming as well.

 However, based on past trends, it’s not unreasonable to believe that the Nothing Phone 3 will be priced similarly to the Phone 2, which starts at $599.

 The Phone 2 received a significant boost to the hardware, camera, and Glyph options and a considerable price bump from the Phone 1, which was offered for a limited time in the U.S. for $299 and launched at €469 in Europe.

 We see the Phone 3 trending toward similar upgrades, which might warrant a higher price, considering that the recent Phone 2a was meant to serve as a more budget-friendly step down from the flagship Phone 2.

 The Phone 3 could see a steeper starting price as the next full flagship model, especially if one of those changes comes in the form of a chip level-up.

## Pre-Order Information

 The Nothing Phone 3 hasn't yet been announced by Nothing, which means we don't have any pre-order information. Once we know more, we’ll update details here, so stay tuned. We’ll also detail how widely available the Phone 3 will be for pre-ordering.

## Nothing Phone 3 Specs and Features

 Since the Phone 3 isn't an official product, it’s hard to say for sure what we’ll see in the Phone 3\. But here’s some reliable chatter so far.

### A Newer Chip (but Just How New)?

 It’s still early stages, but a lot of buzz surrounds the processor Nothing will land on for its third-generation flagship phone.

 The Phone 2 leveled up from the Phone 1’s Snapdragon 778G+ to the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1\. Some speculation says that the Phone 3 will get a considerable upgrade. A leak on[91mobiles.com](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nothing-phone-3-india-price-range-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-chip-report/) points to a Phone 3 with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, two big rungs above the Phone 2’s processor.

 Another speculation is that the[Phone 3 will stick to the trend of previous-generation chips](https://www.gizchina.com/2024/04/23/nothing-phone-3-expected-this-summer-but-not-a-flagship-killer/) , which would point toward a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Phone 3.

### Better Battery

 The Phone 2 made significant strides with a 4,700-mAh battery, an impressive boost compared to the Phone 1's 4500 mAh (for comparison, the iPhone 15 Plus has a 4,383-mAh battery). The newest model is likely to improve upon these gains and catch up with competitors by offering faster wired charging and bigger capacity.

### Improved Camera

 The dual-camera design of the Phone 1 and Phone 2 will likely carry over.[Phone Arena reports that the Phone 3 might get Sony's latest LYTIA sensor lineup](https://www.phonearena.com/nothing-phone-3-release-date-price-upgtades) , which could mean even more control and a richer photo-taking experience in various lighting conditions and environments.

### Signature Glyph, Improved

 While the overall look is likely going to remain untouched, If we had to put our money on one sure thing for the Phone 3, we’d say the signature Nothing Phone Glyph interface will see improvements akin to what we’ve seen from the Phone 1 to Phone 2\. The Phone 2 added six more LED panels, customizable notifications, and a composer for arranging ringtones.

### An Action Button

 Nothing CEO Carl Pei teased several shots of an updated design on X. Though the below post asks for feedback on Nothing OS user interface updates, many suspect that Pei might have leaked the Nothing Phone 3.

 In this rendering, it has an additional external button on the right side. Some speculate this button[could mimic the iPhone 15's Action Button](https://beebom.com/did-carl-pei-leak-nothing-phone-3-with-action-button/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Integrated AI

 Pei also released a video on X announcing the company's AI prototyping. Pei alluded to a[heavy AI presence on the Nothing Phone 3](https://www.lifewire.com/carl-pei-nothing-ai-phone-3-8658876) .

 The only timing clue Pei offered was a "next year" tag for the slow rollout of AI, starting with the Nothing Phone 3.  

 We’ll continue to make updates as we learn about more rumors, leaks, and official word from Nothing.
