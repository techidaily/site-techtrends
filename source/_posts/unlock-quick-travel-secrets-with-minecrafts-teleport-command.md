## How to Fix an iPhone That Won't Ring

 Try these common fixes in the order that we present them:

1. [Restart the iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288) . The first step in troubleshooting any device is to restart it. A restart can fix many glitches.  
 Another important troubleshooting step is to[update your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-ios-on-iphone-connecting-itunes-1999188) so it has the latest version of the iOS operating system.
2. [Clean the iPhone speaker](https://www.lifewire.com/clean-iphone-speakers-4692263) . Every sound your iPhone makes—playing music, watching movies, or the ringer from incoming calls—comes from the speaker at the bottom of the device. If you don't hear the ringer for incoming calls, the speaker may be dirty or broken.  
 Test the speaker by playing music or a video. Turn up the volume. If you can hear audio, but the volume is too low, or the sound is distorted, clean the speaker.  
 If you hear no sound, even with the volume turned all the way up, the iPhone speakers may be broken. Learn how to[fix iPhone speakers](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-non-working-iphone-speaker-4177315) .
3. [Turn off mute](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-the-iphone-ringer-off-2000565) . Make sure you haven't silenced your iPhone and forgotten to turn the ringer back on.
4. [Turn off Do Not Disturb](https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-iphone-apple-watch-2000547) . DND is a useful feature that enables you to silence sounds from calls, texts, and notifications when you don't want to be bothered. You can turn on DND manually or schedule it, so be sure to check both options.  
 You can check for DND at a glance. If a moon icon appears in the upper-right corner of the home screen, DND is on. (On[iPhone X](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-x-4150706) , the moon icon appears only in Control Center.)  
 If you schedule DND, you may need to adjust the settings.
5. Unblock a blocked number. If someone says they called you, but there's no sign of the call on your iPhone, you may have blocked that person's number. Apple introduced the ability to block voice calls, FaceTime calls, and text messages in iOS 7\. To[unblock a number on iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/unblock-number-on-iphone-or-ipad-4169728) , complete these steps:  
   1. Tap**Settings** \>**Phone** \>**Blocked Contacts** .  
   2. Tap**Edit** .  
   3. Tap the red circle beside the blocked number, and then tap**Unblock** .

6. Disable Silence Unknown Callers. To help users avoid spam calls and robocalls, Apple added a feature in[iOS 13](https://www.lifewire.com/ios-13-4586609) that automatically silences all calls from unknown numbers. If this feature is turned on, you won't hear calls from numbers that aren't in the Contacts app. Instead, the iPhone sends them right to voicemail. To disable this feature, select**Settings** \>**Phone** , and then turn off the**Silence Unknown Callers** switch.  
 If you want to keep Silence Unknown Callers turned on but still get calls from certain numbers,[add those callers to Contacts](https://www.lifewire.com/manage-contacts-iphone-address-book-2000570) .

7. Change your custom ringtone. If your iPhone still doesn't ring for incoming calls, check your ringtone. If you[set up unique ringtones for contacts](https://www.lifewire.com/assign-unique-ringtone-on-iphone-2000557) , a deleted or corrupted ringtone can prevent the phone from ringing when someone calls.  
 To check the default ringtone, tap**Settings** \>**Sounds & Haptics** \>**Ringtone** , and then select a new ringtone.  
 If you miss calls from only certain people, open the Phone app, and then complete these steps:  
   1. Tap**Contacts** .  
   2. Tap the name of the person whose calls you're missing, and then tap**Edit** .  
   3. Tap**Ringtone** , and then assign the contact a new ringtone.

 If the unique ringtone is the source of the problem, find all the contacts to whom you assigned that ringtone and select a new ringtone for each.
8. [Make sure the phone isn't stuck in Headphone mode](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-iphone-stuck-in-headphone-mode-4175912) . It could be that your iPhone is ringing but sending the audio to the wrong place. In this situation, the iPhone thinks that another audio source is attached to it—like headphones or a Bluetooth device—and tries to ring there instead of through your iPhone speaker.
