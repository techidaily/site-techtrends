5. If you provide valid login information, NBC Sports will remove the time limit, and you'll be able to watch the entire event.  
 Since the NBC Sports website only provides a short free trial viewing period, this isn't a good method for cord-cutters. For a longer trial, look at services like Hulu or fuboTV.

##  What Streaming Services Include the Olympic Games? 

 The best way for cord-cutters to stream the Olympics is through an internet streaming service. These services provide television access that's a lot like cable, except you stream live television through the internet. You need a computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or a compatible smart TV and a high-speed internet connection to use one of these services.

 Each of these streaming services has signed deals with networks and TV stations, which allows them to broadcast live television. That's why you get access to a live NBC stream on some services, and others only provide you with on-demand pre-recorded content from NBC. Availability is based on your physical location and whether or not any given service has made a deal with your local NBC affiliate.

* [ Hulu with Live TV](https://www.lifewire.com/hulu-live-tv-4165344) : This service provides the broadest access to NBC. If it isn't available in your area, try a different one.
* [ YouTube TV](https://www.lifewire.com/youtube-tv-4155151) : NBC is available in most major markets and many smaller markets through this service.
* [ DirecTV Stream](https://www.lifewire.com/att-now-4155821) : This service also has decent NBC coverage.
* [ Sling TV](https://www.lifewire.com/sling-tv-4154536) : NBC is only available in select markets through this service, but it's a very affordable option if your area is covered.
* [ fuboTV](https://www.lifewire.com/fubotv-4159948) : This sports-focused streaming service has limited NBC coverage, but it's still worth checking out in case your area is included.

##  Watching an Olympics Online Stream on Mobile, Streaming Devices, and Consoles 

 In addition to streaming through a web browser on your computer, you can also stream the Olympics on your phone, tablet, streaming device, and even game console if you have the right app. Check your app store to get the app you need for your device.

 NBC Sports has apps for most major devices, but you still need a valid cable or satellite subscription to log in.

##  Can You Watch the Olympics With an Antenna? 

 Since NBC has the rights to the Olympics in the United States, you can watch a lot of coverage for free if you have an antenna and a local NBC affiliate. You'll miss out on any coverage NBC shifts to its cable channels and online streams, but the most popular events are usually broadcast on NBC.

 To watch the Olympics with this method, all you need is a television and an antenna. If you have an older TV, you'll also need a digital converter box, and you may also have to upgrade your older antenna as well. Check out our roundup of digital TV antennas if you don't already have one.

[  How to Connect a DTV Converter Box to an Analog TV ](https://www.lifewire.com/dtv-converter-to-analog-tv-3276563) 

 If you're all set up with an antenna, you can hook it up to your computer and use Plex Live TV to stream the Olympics to your computers, laptops, and mobile devices.

 This method also requires a TV tuner card for your computer. It takes the free TV signal from your antenna, processes it on your computer, then streams it to your devices.
