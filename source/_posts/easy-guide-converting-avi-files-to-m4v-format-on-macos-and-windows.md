| Limitations     | M4V files won't open and play in Android and other non-Apple devices. Users need M4V converters to solve such issue. And some M4V videos from iTunes come with DRM copy protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | AVI cannot contain some variable bitrate data. AVI is a quite out-dated format that has many drawbacks we won't see in MP4, MKV etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
