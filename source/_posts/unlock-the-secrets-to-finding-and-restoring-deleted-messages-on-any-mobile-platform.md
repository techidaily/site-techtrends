 Deleted text messages in iOS 16 and later are available for recovery in the Messages app for only 30 days.

##  How to Recover Text Messages for iPhone Using iCloud 

 The process involves restoring your device with data from a recent iCloud backup. Any messages that were present on your phone at the time of the backup are retrievable.

[  How to Recover Deleted Screenshots on iPhone ](https://www.lifewire.com/recover-deleted-screenshots-on-iphone-5213328) 

 Be aware that your phone might not be backing up to iCloud and even if it is, it might not be backing up information from the Messages app. Before following the steps below, you might need to[ back up your text messages](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-save-text-messages-4172887) .

 Only data and messages present on your device at the time the backup occurred appear on your iPhone after the restoration process finishes.

1. Go to**Settings** \>**General** . Then, scroll down and tap**Reset** or**Transfer or Reset iPhone** \>**Reset** .  
 This method is not for the faint of heart. You delete the data currently stored on your iPhone and then restore your iPhone with the data from a recent backup. Any new messages or other content that happened after the last backup is lost.
2. Tap**Erase All Content and Settings** .

3. Turn on your iPhone and begin setting it up as if it were new.

4. When you arrive at the window titled**Apps and Data** or**Transfer Your Apps & Data** , select**Restore from iCloud Backup** .  
 Alternatively, you can choose to**Restore from iTunes Backup** if you've been backing up directly to your computer using iTunes.
5. Your iPhone may ask you to sign in to your iCloud account using your Apple ID and password. Do so to proceed.
6. A list of recent backups appears. If there is more than one backup, you may choose the backup you want to use by checking its date and time.
7. Wait for a while as the data transfer process completes. Once it's done, you should have all the messages and data you had at the time of the backup you selected.

##  Recover Deleted iPhone Text Messages Using iTunes 

 If you regularly sync your iPhone with iTunes on your Mac rather than iCloud, iTunes has a backup available from each time you synced—unless you turned off the feature to automatically sync your iPhone with your computer.

 If you want to get that text message back and you've been backing up your iPhone to your computer, then you can likely retrieve it using a recent backup.

 This method erases the data currently on your iPhone and replaces it with a snapshot of the data that was on your iPhone the last time you backed it up. If you aren't comfortable doing this, you may prefer another method.

1. Connect your iPhone to your computer using an appropriate cable. Your iPhone may ask you to unlock it. If it does, go ahead and do so.
2. If iTunes doesn't open automatically, open iTunes on your computer manually.
3. Select the iPhone icon just below and to the right of the Play button.  
 If you have more than one connected device, select**iPhone** from the drop-down menu.  
![Selecting iPhone in iTunes](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gXezty5SFyWaoc69A7BHimhbNao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003-recover-deleted-text-messages-on-any-phone-4172567-44383e96fbd94a7484cbddc4bd382e78.jpg)
4. In the**Backups** section on the right side of the**Summary** screen, you should see options to manually back up and restore your iPhone, along with the date and method of your most recent backup. Select**Restore Backup** to proceed.  
![Restoring iPhone backup from iTunes](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZmyhgdIvIZ2SH59u8iejRQQ1bHU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004-recover-deleted-text-messages-on-any-phone-4172567.-398171d5b8984332b2c123770b1229e0.jpg)
5. The most recent backup replaces all the data on your phone. The process takes a while. You should see your missing text messages if your most recent backup took place before they were deleted.

##  You Can Also Recover Using a Third-Party App for iPhone 

 If neither of the above methods works for you, the next option is to try a third-party app to recover your deleted text messages.

 There are plenty of apps out there designed to help you recover deleted text messages, many of which offer free trials and can be used to recover other types of lost data from an iPhone as well.

 For example, the[ PhoneRescue](https://www.imobie.com/phonerescue/ios-data-recovery.htm) and[ Dr.fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-data-recovery.html) text message recovery apps for iPhone often get positive reviews.
