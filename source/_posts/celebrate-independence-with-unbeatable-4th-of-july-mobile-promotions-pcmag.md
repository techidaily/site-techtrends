## Top Smartphone Bargains: Unbeatable iPhone Promotions in July 2024  Roundup

Shopping for a [new iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/) can be a lengthy and sometimes stressful process, especially when a new generation of phones is announced. 

There's a lot to consider when deciding which model to get and looking for ways to save money on your purchase. Thankfully, carriers tend to launch frequent promotions on all of Apple's iPhone models. That means you're not locked into getting whatever the newest (and most expensive) iPhone is. But if the latest iPhone 15 is what you're after, we've found the best deals available.

If you know where to look, you can also find deals on models including the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and the iPhone 14, both carrier-locked and unlocked. You'll notice that many carrier deals have the potential to net you a free iPhone, including the latest models. Naturally, the devil's in the details (the fine print) for any smartphone deal. But that's why we're here.

Trade-in discounts are also available for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, with a discount of up to $700 for grabs. You can also take $100 off the retail price when you buy Ray-Ban smart glasses.

T-Mobile will give customers an iPhone 15 for free if they sign up for a suitable plan and trade in an older device. 

The discount is applied in 24 monthly bill credits. 

Alternatively, you can receive up to $830 off your new iPhone with the trade-in of an older device and under a qualifying Go5G Plus or Next plan. This deal applies to the entire iPhone lineup -- the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Apple/ZDNET

Verizon customers purchasing an iPhone 15 can save $830, and no trade-in is required if they agree to sign up for an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan.

For a limited time, the company will also give you a free iPad (9th-gen) or $120 off an Apple Watch SE when you purchase a 5G-enabled iPhone. In addition, you can take $150 off the price of a pair of Beats Studio Pro wireless headphones when you buy any new iPhone, Apple Watch, or iPad.

While we often purchase our new smartphones via our carriers, ordering your new device directly from Apple is also an option. 

If you prefer to pick up an unlocked iPhone 15, you will be given up to $630 in credit from the tech giant when you trade in an older device. You will also receive up to 3% Apple Card cashback.

Apple/ZDNET

Over at T-Mobile, both new and existing customers can pick up a device from the iPhone 14 range for free when they switch or with a $730 discount (via bill credits) when they trade in an eligible device. To get this deal, you'll have to trade a suitable device, and depending on the model and condition, your discount will vary.

## How did we choose these iPhone deals?

While researching the best Apple iPhone deals, we scoured the web and checked out major US retailers and telecoms' promotional prices, including Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. 

We wanted to ensure we found the best iPhone deals, including the new flagship models and older variants. We've shown you the best discounts and trade-in offers, but remember that stocks can be limited and sales pulled at any time. 

Factors influencing our recommendations include:

* **Price**: The main factor we consider is the price. If the discount isn't noteworthy relative to the original price point -- or no trade-in offers are available -- then we don't consider it worthy of inclusion.
* **Variety**: Here at ZDNET, we want to provide you with a variety of iPhone options with bonuses. We've selected deals that bring down the price of your new handset, alongside bonus incentives such as free services or discounts on other devices in the Apple ecosystem.
* **Availability**: If we come across a great Apple deal but only a few units are in stock, unless it is a stellar saving you only see once in a blue moon, we will discount it and select a product with better stock levels instead.

## What is the best iPhone?

The best iPhone currently on the market is the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch model is the largest of the iPhone 15 line and comes stacked with Apple's latest features, such as a strong, lightweight titanium design, Dynamic Island, an A17 Pro chip, and a 48MP Main camera that shoots detailed imagery.

## When will the iPhone 16 come out?

While it's too early for us to know any definitive details, Apple typically refreshes its smartphone lineup once a year. 

However, if the iPad and iPhone maker follows its usual schedule, considering the iPhone 15 was launched in September 2023, we can expect an iPhone 16 to appear around September 2024.
