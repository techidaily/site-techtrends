## What Causes Lines on a Monitor?

 Horizontal lines on a computer monitor are often caused by the following:

* Overheating or physical damage to the monitor and connecting cables
* Conflicts between the screen and selected screen resolution

## How to Fix Lines on a Computer Screen

 Here are all the best solutions for eliminating horizontal lines on your screen:  

1. Turn your monitor off and on again. It seems like a basic fix, but it can often correct screen glitches, such as horizontal lines.
2. [Change your monitor’s refresh rate](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-monitor-refresh-rate-setting-in-windows-2626207) . Switching to another[refresh rate setting](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984) can help with lines and screen flickering.
3. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . This can fix a variety of tech issues and could get rid of any flickering lines on your screen.
4. Try a different monitor. Doing so can help you determine if the lines are caused by your computer’s screen or the computer itself.
5. Check your monitor while it’s disconnected. Keep it powered on, unplug it from your computer, and look for any flickering or lines on the screen while it’s disconnected. If you see any distortion, it means your monitor is damaged.
6. Detach and reattach the keyboard. If you have a computer that uses a removable keyboard, reseating it for just a few seconds could be the fix.
7. Close and reopen your laptop slowly. Examine when the lines appear on the screen as you open it. If the lines only occur at a certain angle, the cause is likely damaged wiring.
8. Use your laptop on a hard surface. Soft surfaces, such as on a blanket or tablecloth, can cause overheating, resulting in screen flickering and lines.

9. Disable Instant Replay if it's enabled. According to some users, the fix for the screen's horizontal lines is to disable this feature or change its storage destination to an SSD instead of a traditional HDD. The option is in the app's**Recording** settings.  
 This is only relevant for[AMD Radeon ReLive](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/DH-023.html) users who have this feature turned on.

If you notice the image improves or worsens while touching the connecting cable, it may need replacement.
