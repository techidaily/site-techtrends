## What Causes Lines on a Monitor?

 Horizontal lines on a computer monitor are often caused by the following:

* Overheating or physical damage to the monitor and connecting cables
* Conflicts between the screen and selected screen resolution
* Incorrect refresh rate settings
* Out-of-date device drivers
* Bending the laptop screen too far in the opposite direction
* Water damage

 Some of these are easy to fix, while others might require a trip to the repair shop.

## How to Fix Lines on a Computer Screen

 Here are all the best solutions for eliminating horizontal lines on your screen:  

1. Turn your monitor off and on again. It seems like a basic fix, but it can often correct screen glitches, such as horizontal lines.
2. [Change your monitor’s refresh rate](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-monitor-refresh-rate-setting-in-windows-2626207) . Switching to another[refresh rate setting](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984) can help with lines and screen flickering.
3. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . This can fix a variety of tech issues and could get rid of any flickering lines on your screen.
4. Try a different monitor. Doing so can help you determine if the lines are caused by your computer’s screen or the computer itself.
5. Check your monitor while it’s disconnected. Keep it powered on, unplug it from your computer, and look for any flickering or lines on the screen while it’s disconnected. If you see any distortion, it means your monitor is damaged.
6. Detach and reattach the keyboard. If you have a computer that uses a removable keyboard, reseating it for just a few seconds could be the fix.
7. Close and reopen your laptop slowly. Examine when the lines appear on the screen as you open it. If the lines only occur at a certain angle, the cause is likely damaged wiring.
8. Use your laptop on a hard surface. Soft surfaces, such as on a blanket or tablecloth, can cause overheating, resulting in screen flickering and lines.

9. Disable Instant Replay if it's enabled. According to some users, the fix for the screen's horizontal lines is to disable this feature or change its storage destination to an SSD instead of a traditional HDD. The option is in the app's**Recording** settings.  
 This is only relevant for[AMD Radeon ReLive](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/DH-023.html) users who have this feature turned on.
10. Install the latest operating system updates. Old software conflicting with newer hardware could cause the lines on your computer screen. It's easy to[update Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) or[update macOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-a-mac-5119468) .
11. [Check the monitor connection](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-disconnected-monitor-power-cable-connections-2624532) . Ensure all cables are securely connected, and watch for any improvements in screen image quality while inspecting the cables. If you notice the image improves or worsens while touching the connecting cable, it may need replacement.
12. Remove magnets and electronics. If you have other electronics or magnetic devices near your computer, screen, or connecting cables, move them somewhere else as they may interfere with the connection and cause the lines.
13. [Clean your computer and monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/clean-your-pc-5074108) . Dust may be causing them to overheat and create visual distortions.
14. Change the screen resolution. It's easy to[edit the Windows screen resolution](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-adjust-the-screen-resolution-setting-in-windows-2626208) or the settings on your Mac. So, give this a go before moving on to the more complex steps below.
15. [Calibrate your monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/test-and-calibrate-your-pc-monitor-2640280) . This process should only take a few minutes and can help optimize your monitor for use with your computer and its environment.
16. [Update your Windows device drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Check for driver updates for profiles associated with your monitor and screen.  
 Some users have found that_downgrading_ their video card driver was the fix. If you recently upgraded your drivers, consider[rolling back to the previous version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) instead.
17. Run a troubleshooter. Search your computer for a video troubleshooter or program compatibility tool. If you get presented with recommendations for other troubleshooters, run those too. Your computer will attempt to fix any problems automatically.

19. Contact the support team for your computer to ask about repair, replacement, or device-specific troubleshooting steps for the lines on the screen.
20. [Upgrade to a new monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/choosing-a-computer-monitor-5204228) , or[buy a new laptop](https://www.lifewire.com/best-places-to-buy-a-laptop-4164557) .
