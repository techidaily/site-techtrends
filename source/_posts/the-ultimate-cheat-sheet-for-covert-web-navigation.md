### Fix 3: Uninstall unnecessary Chrome apps and extensions

 Here is how:

1. On your Google Chrome, click **the** **three dots button**  in the upper-right corner.

### Fix 4: Close arenâ€™t using tabs and processes

 If youâ€™ve opened too many tabs on your Chrome, obviously these tabs will slow down your speed. Because each tab opens its own process on your PC. These tabs will consume lots of resources, which will drag your Chrome speed. You can also close other background processes to release resources so that your Chrome speed would raise up.  
 By doing this, follow the steps below:

1. Press **Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Esc** at the same time to open the Task Manager.
2. Choose the app you want to close and click End task.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/g7.jpg)

### Fix 5: Turn on network action predictions

 The prediction service on your Chrome is a feature that allows Chrome to predict your actions ahead of time so that it can speed up the page load times. Check if you enabled this feature, if not, follow the instructions below to enable it:

1. On your Google Chrome, click **the three dots button**  in the upper-right corner and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/g2.jpg)
2. Scroll down to the bottom and click Advanced. Turn on**Preload pages for faster browsing and searching** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/g8.jpg)

### Fix 6: Clear browsing data

 To much cache and history data could affect the Chrome speed. So it is suggested that you clear the cache and browsing data to speed up your Chrome.

 **Note: This operation will clear all your browsing history, passwords and preferences on your browser** . And you will need to re-enter your passwords and re-adjust your preferences when you access all websites you have visited.

Here is how to do it:

1. In the Chrome address bar, copy and paste[chrome://settings/clearBrowserData](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Then press**Enter** .
2. Set the time range to **cover from when you started to use your browser till now** .

### Fix 7: Reset Chrome to the default settings

 This method is like a combination for Fix 3 and Fix 5\. It will clear temporary data and disable all extensions. But your bookmarks, history and saved passwords wonâ€™t be cleared.

1. On your Google Chrome, click **the three dots button**  in the upper-right corner and click**Settings** .

### Fix 8:**Update your network driver**

 If the network driver on your PC is missing or outdated, it may also cause the Chrome slow issue. To speed up Chrome, you need to keep your network driver up to date.

There are two ways to update your drivers:

**[Option 1 â€“ Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-speed-up-google-chrome-easily-quickly/#op2) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 â€“** **Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 â€“ Automatically update network drivers**

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/network1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with Free version). Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
