## How to Activate Picture-in-Picture

 As long as picture-in-picture is turned on in the Android settings, you can trigger it by simply returning to the Home Screen. For example, when a full screen video is playing in Google Chrome, press**Home** to activate PiP.

[Update your Android apps](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-on-android-7106106) and[update the Android OS](https://www.lifewire.com/update-your-android-os-121662) if picture-in-picture isn't working for a supported app.

 When you've figured out how to launch PiP in your favorite app, you'll see a window with your video or other content.

 Tap the window to access the controls. In some cases, you'll see the standard video playback controls, like**Play/Pause** and**Full screen** . Some videos have fewer controls, possibly just an**Exit** icon. Some apps have a headphone icon you can tap to play audio in the background without seeing the video.

![The picture-in-picture controls for a YouTube video on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UW-uCj79RBhShRK2mu9WD95kZqs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/android-picture-in-picture-05243da82fff48f096c6afc680a4282a.png)

 Tap and hold the picture-in-picture window to reposition it. You can drag it up or down and pinch the PiP window to resize it. To close the picture-in-picture window, either tap the**X** in the corner or drag the video to the bottom of the screen into the**X** bubble.  

## Apps That Work With Picture-in-Picture

## What Is Picture-in-Picture?

 Picture-in-picture (PiP) is an optional multitasking feature. It shrinks a video stream or other content into its own box on top of your other apps so that the rest of the screen can be used for other tasks. For instance, you can search for a restaurant in your web browser app while video chatting or watching a video.

 PiP is a nice feature for heavy multitaskers who jump from app to app. It's available on Android smartphones running Android 8.0 Oreo and later.
