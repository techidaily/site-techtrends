## Enhance Visual Experience: Resetting the GPU Driver Across Various Windows Operating Systems

If your graphics card is not working well, you may encounter a black or flickering screen on your Windows device. To fix the problem, one simple way is to reset the graphics driver. In this post, you’ll learn how to reset your graphics driver easily and quickly.

## Before you start

 When you see a black screen, you can first try the keyboard shortcut:**Windows logo key + Ctrl + Shift + B** . This will force Windows to refresh the screen. If Windows is responsive, a short beep will sound and the screen will blink or dim.

 If this method didn’t work, try the following steps to reset your graphics driver.

## Reset/Restart your graphics driver

 To reset your graphics driver, simply uninstall the driver from Device Manager and then reinstall it again. Here’s how:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** .

2. Locate**Display adapters** , select the arrow to expand it, then right-click your graphics card and select**Uninstall device** .

4. After the uninstallation is complete, restart your computer. Windows will reinstall the graphics driver automatically.

 If your problem still persists after restarting your graphics driver, you may consider updating the graphics driver.

## Update your graphics driver

 There are mainly two ways to update the graphics driver. One way is to go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) ) for your graphics card and look for the latest and most compatible graphics driver for your Windows version. Then download and install the driver manually.

 However, if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy is a driver update tool that can automatically identify and download all the drivers you need. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong drivers, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

Here’s how it works:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)
