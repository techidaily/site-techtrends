###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 The Afeela looks poised to be available in North America by spring 2026.

##  Sony Car (Afeela) Price Rumors 

[ According to The Verge's early reporting](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23539863/sony-honda-electric-vehicle-afeela-ces-reveal-photos) , the Afeela’s pricing will match competitors in the luxury vehicle space, like Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Porsche, including possible subscription models to some of its services. But competition with and resemblance to the Tesla, specifically the Tesla Model S, feels pretty undeniable. Some even see similarities to models such as the Porsche 911.

 Trim levels and exact offerings are yet unknown, but[ Car and Driver estimates](https://www.caranddriver.com/afeela/ev-sedan) the Afeela will be $45,000\. On the other hand,[ Nikkei Asia reports](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Sony-and-Honda-EV-venture-to-launch-SUV-and-compact-before-2030) that the Afeela EV sedan will likely hover above 10 million yen, which is the equivalent of about $66,143.

 As concept-to-production details take shape, we expect to hear more rumors about pricing, so stay tuned.

## Sony Car (Afeela) Features 

 The Sony car has been a concept for a while, but with the updated prototype unveiled at CES 2024 and recent announcements about collaborations with the likes of Microsoft and Epic Games, the expected feature set is starting to take shape in the production-ready model.

 Here’s what we’ve seen in the mix from Sony Honda Mobility:

* **Customizable Media Bar** : One distinctive exterior highlight is the Media Bar, a thin display between the headlights, which serves as a sort of self-expression and communication tool. Some of its tricks include charging indicator levels and displaying digital stickers.
* **Built-in Microsoft AI assistant** : The Afeela will get a[ personal assistant using Microsoft Azure OpenAI](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2024-01-08%5F4/) . This assistant, dubbed the Mobility Personal Agent, is part of the company’s vision for an “advanced voice-enabled system that delivers seamless communication with natural language and conversation-like interactions.”
* **Immersive infotainment with a gaming bent** : The Afeela will be like a moving movie theater with infotainment screens throughout, movie and music choices for passengers, and a noise-canceling, spatial audio sound system. SHM has also announced it’s working with Epic Games and its Unreal Engine, the power behind_Fortnite_ , to develop an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience. This feature will look like 3D views of the road from any angle but also offer a gamified view of real-life objects.

 Another key SHM partnership is with Polyphony Digital, which came to life when the Afeela prototype became available in the racing simulation game_Gran Turismo 7_ with an April patch.[ MotorTrend](https://www.motortrend.com/features/sony-afeela-ev-sedan-virtual-first-drive-playstation-gran-turismo/) speculates that the game dimensions indicate the real-life figures, similar to a 2024 Honda Accord. 

 The game version of the Sony Car also allows users to play PlayStation games on the in-cabin infotainment system via[ Remote Play](https://www.lifewire.com/remote-play-ps5-games-on-android-5089611) .

 How much more actual integrated gaming will be possible in the real Aleefa is still unknown and something we’ll be on the lookout for.
