* Clearing the data cache can make apps run better and fix things like login issues and unresponsiveness.

 This article explains how to clear the data cache on Android. Most of these directions apply to most versions of Android, but some of them are specific to Android 7 and older.

##  How to Clear an Android App's Data Cache

 Here's how to clear data for an app you know (or suspect) is causing problems or using up data.

1. Open**Settings** \>**Apps** .
2. Select the app whose cache you want to clear.

3. Tap**Storage & cache** or**Storage** .  
 This same process is how you[ clear the cache on some Samsung phones](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-on-samsung-s10-5182265) .
4. Tap**Clear cache** to clear the app cache. Tap**Clear data** or**Clear storage** to erase the data associated with the app.  
 Clearing the cache deletes temporary files the app uses while it's running. Clearing data deletes settings, passwords, and other information you added and resets the app to its defaults.

 Some Android phones include a bulk option for clearing cache. If your phone has a**Device care** app, open the**Storage** section and check if there's an**App cache** option. From there, you can select**All** to clear cache for all your apps at once.

##  How Clearing an App's Cache Can Help

 The cache contains temporary files that are used to speed up the app. Sometimes, though, they're too much of a good thing. The data cache might be taking up too much space or it could be outdated or corrupted. These things can cause the app to behave erratically or crash.

 Often, you'll know which app is acting up simply by its behavior. If this isn't the case, start your cache-clearing with the browser, then move on to social media apps. Turn next to other apps that access the internet, then to those that occupy the most overall space.

 Clearing cache is a temporary space-saving method. As you use an app, it will build up a new cache of temporary files. Here are some[ other ways to recover storage space on your Android](https://www.lifewire.com/free-up-space-on-android-5101088) .

##  How to Clear the Entire Phone's Cache at Once

 Before the release of Oreo (Android version 8), the easiest way to deal with the device cache was to delete it all at once. However, Google removed this feature in newer versions. If you're still running an old version, such as on your[ Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-on-samsung-s9-5179456) , here's how to delete the entire device cache:

1. Open**Settings** .
2. Tap**Storage** .
3. Tap**Cached data** . Android calculates where the device storage is being used (apps, photos, or other places) and how much you will reclaim. When prompted, confirm your choice.  
 Clearing the cache data does not erase any personal information or important data.
