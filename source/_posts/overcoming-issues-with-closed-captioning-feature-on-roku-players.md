## Overcoming Issues with Closed Captioning Feature on Roku Players

Close 

 Closed captioning is helpful you're hard of hearing, prefer to read what people are saying, are unable to understand the language, etc. Here's how to get closed captioning working again on a Roku.

 The most likely "fix" for closed captions not working is to learn how they work—there are, surprisingly, a few ways to enable subtitles on the Roku, depending on the app you're using.  

##  Causes of Roku Captions Not Working 

 Captions on Roku might not be behaving as expected due to several reasons:

* Close captions are disabled
* Caption settings need adjusting
* Roku apps may need updating
* There could be an issue with a specific app
* The Roku system requires an update

##  What to Do When Roku Closed Captions Aren't Working 

 Enabling closed captions on your Roku is simple. However, captions might still not work as you expect, either because of a software glitch or an app that uses its own subtitle options. Try these troubleshooting tips in the following order to resolve the issue.

1. Make sure the Roku's closed captioning setting is toggled on from**Settings** \>**Accessibility** \>**Captions mode** . It seems obvious, but they might have been turned off without you realizing it. If they already are, shut them off, reboot the Roku, and then turn them back on.  
 Don't skip over this step. Even if captions are already enabled, a reboot might be all that's needed to get them to show up. Do this through**Settings** \>**System** \>**System restart** \>**Restart** .
2. Verify the caption styles. Go to**Settings** \>**Accessibility** \>**Captions style** , and walk through the**Text size** ,**Text color** ,**Text opacity** , and other relevant options, adjusting them as needed.  
 Make sure they aren't customized to the point they aren't showing up correctly. They may be working just fine, but you can't see them very well.
3. Use the app's built-in closed captioning control if it has one. For example, if you're on YouTube, press the**up arrow** using the Roku remote until you reach the small menu right above the progress bar. Select the captions button and choose an option from that menu, such as**English (auto-generated)** .  
 Other apps are different, like Netflix's, where you need to press the**down arrow** on the remote to use the menu. One example of an option there is**English \[Original\] with Subtitles** .

4. Use the mobile app's captioning button, if possible. If the Roku remote or TV app won't let you enable closed captions, and the service you're using has a mobile app that supports Roku, look for an option there.  
 Streaming services like Netflix and YouTube have mobile apps to cast video to the TV via the Roku. Playback and subtitle control are available directly from the app when you do this. YouTube uses a**CC** button for this purpose, and there's a similar option on the Netflix app and other streaming apps.

5. Like the previous step, try casting from the service's desktop site. If enabling captions via the Roku app or mobile app isn't possible, there's likely an option through the desktop site.

 YouTube subtitle options.
6. Check for a Roku update. Update checks occur automatically, but you can also check manually through**Settings** \>**System** \>**Software update** \>**Check now** . A bug could be to blame, and the only way to fix that is through a system update.  
 An individual app could also be the culprit. First check for individual updates by selecting the app you're using > pressing the**Star** button on the Roku remote >**Check for updates** .
7. [ Reset your Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-roku-4174678) . An issue with closed captioning is fully software-related, so if none of the above has fixed the problem, a complete software reset is your final option.

##  How Do I Activate Closed Captions On Roku? 

 There's an option in the Roku settings which you need to enable for closed captioning to work:

 These instructions cover the standard way to enable subtitles on a Roku. Doing this turns on the system-wide captions, hence why you need to go into the device's settings to enable it.

1. Press the**Home** button to go to the home screen.
2. Go to**Settings** \>**Accessibility** \>**Captions mode** .
