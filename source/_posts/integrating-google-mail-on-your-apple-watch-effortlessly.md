 This article explains how to set up and use Gmail on the Apple Watch. It also covers third-party apps that deliver Gmail features on Apple Watch that the official Gmail app doesn't.

## How to Set Up Gmail on Apple Watch

 The official Gmail app doesn't work on the Apple Watch. Google hasn't added support for the Watch to its app, so you can't read or send emails with it.

 But, if you've configured the Gmail app to send you notifications, those notifications can appear on your Apple Watch just like the alerts you get for calls or texts. Here's what to do:

1. Install the official Gmail app and set up the Gmail app on your iPhone.
2. Tap**Settings** .
3. Tap**Gmail** .

4. Tap**Notifications** .
5. Configure your Gmail notification settings in the way you prefer.

6. Open the**Watch** app.
7. Tap**Notifications** .
8. In the**Mirror iPhone Alerts From** section, move the**Gmail** slider to**on/green** . Any time the Gmail app on your iPhone sends you a notification, you'll get the same alert on your Apple Watch.

## Third-Party Apps That Add Gmail to Apple Watch

 The official Gmail app may not run on the Apple Watch, but some third-party email apps support Gmail and work on Apple Watch. Use one of those, and you can get Gmail on Apple Watch. Here's what to do:

1. Download and install on your iPhone the third-party email app you want to use. Make sure to pick one that offers an Apple Watch app. In our example, we'll use Spark Mail.
2. Set up your Gmail account in the app.
