## Get Your Free iPhone User Guides Downloaded Here – Every Version Included
 The iPhone doesn't come with a printed user guide, but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist. You just need to know where to look for it.

 All iPhone models are relatively similar when it comes to hardware. It's the software that's different. Apple releases a user guide that covers all models that can run the latest operating system every time a major new version of iOS comes out.

 Apple produces other instructional materials, such as product and safety information and user guides, for each model. Identify which model you have below, and then download the user guide you need.

 We have several guides here at Lifewire that might address the specific problem you're trying to fix. Use the search bar at the top of this page to see if we've already covered the topic before you jump into these user guides.

## iPhone User Guide for iOS

 This extensive iPhone user guide includes full instructions on how to use your iPhone. If you're looking for a traditional manual, this is it.

 Apple produces a new version for every major iOS release. Available editions of the user guide are here.

## iPhone 15 Series

 The[iPhone 15 series](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-15-5202683) , unveiled in September 2023, includes the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Like the iPhone 14, the 15 series comes in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes.

 The iPhone 15 series features a wireless charging-friendly glass back, rounder edges, and titanium builds for the Pro and Pro Max. (The 15 and 15 Plus retain the aluminum construction.)

[Apple iPhone 15 Pro vs. Pro Max](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-vs-pro-max-8572541)

 The new models have an upgraded A16 or A17 Bionic chip and 5G connectivity. Upgrades include USB-C support, memory up to 1TB for the Pro models, and a portrait mode you can use on existing images, not just new ones.

 Here's more information on this series:

 The iPhone 14 designs are identical to their iPhone 13 cousins, featuring the wireless charging-friendly glass back, flat edges, and aluminum enclosure. The new models also share the iPhone 13's display size, A15 Bionic Processor, and 5G connectivity. Upgrades include a 5-core GPU, more memory, Emergency SOS via satellite, Action Mode to stabilize camera footage, and a Photonic Engine that uses machine learning to revamp the iPhone's image-processing stack.

## iPhone 13 Series

 The[iPhone 13 series](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-13-news-5084086) was unveiled in September 2021\. It included the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The collection mirrored the 12 series with its four variants and brought camera upgrades, generous additional storage, an A15 Bionic Processor, new design elements (a bit thicker and heavier but with a smaller notch), and more.

 The[iPhone 12](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-12-news-5078515) was similar to previous models, especially the [iPhone 11 series](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-11-vs-iphone-11-pro-4770054) , in many ways. It also introduced some significant changes, including 5G integration, a LIDAR sensor, improved photos and videos, Super Retina XDR, design enhancements, new processors, etc.

## iPhone SE

 The iPhone SE looks a lot like the iPhone 5S, but it's stamped with the letters "SE" on the back beneath the iPhone name. That's probably the easiest way to tell which version you have. There have been three versions.

 Here's more information on this series:

* [iPhone SE (2016) overview](https://support.apple.com/112005)
* [iPhone SE (2020 / 2nd gen) overview](https://support.apple.com/111882)
* [iPhone SE (2022 / 3rd gen) overview](https://support.apple.com/111866)

## iPhone 6 Series (6 and 6S)

 The iPhone 6 line included "S" upgrades and the first "Plus" versions of the phone.

 The iPhone 6 Plus and 6S Plus are similar. You won't find much in their documents. It's basic legal information. The user guides above are more instructional and better for regular users.

 Like their larger siblings, the iPhone 6 and 6S are essentially the same device with some minor changes.

 Here's more information on this series:

* [iPhone 6 overview](https://support.apple.com/111954)
* [iPhone 6 Plus overview](https://support.apple.com/111940)
* [iPhone 6s overview](https://support.apple.com/111952)
* [iPhone 6s Plus overview](https://support.apple.com/111996)

## iPhone 5 Series (5, 5S, and 5C)

 The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone with a screen larger than the 3.5 inches the original models sported. This one has a 4-inch screen. At the same time the phone debuted, Apple introduced its new EarPods, replacing the old earbuds that came with earlier iPhones. Documents here include some quick tips for using the iPhone 5 and instructions for using the EarPods.

 You'll know the iPhone 5S as the first iPhone with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The iPhone 5C can be identified by the brightly colored plastic housing used on its back. It's the same size as the iPhone 5; except for the housing, it's almost the exact same phone.

 Here's more information on this series:

* [iPhone 5 overview](https://support.apple.com/112016)
* [iPhone 5s overview](https://support.apple.com/111973)
* [iPhone 5c overview](https://support.apple.com/111917)

## iPhone 4 Series (4 and 4S)

 The iPhone 4 became famous—or, more rightly, infamous—for the "death grip" problem with its antenna. You probably won't find mention of that in either of these downloads.

 The iPhone 4S introduced Siri to the world. When this model debuted, it was the only way to get Apple's personal assistant.

 Here's more information on this series:

* [iPhone 4 overview](https://support.apple.com/112562)
* [iPhone 4s overview](https://support.apple.com/112004)

## iPhone 3G and 3GS

 The iPhone 3G introduced several important features like the App Store, 3G data, and GPS. A year later, the 3MP iPhone 3GS was introduced and it featured a higher-res camera and voice control.

 Here's more information on these phones:

* [iPhone 3G overview](https://support.apple.com/112496)
* [iPhone 3GS overview](https://support.apple.com/112307)

## iPhone (Original)

 Released in 2007, this was the phone that started it all. It had 2G radios and only worked on AT&T's network.
