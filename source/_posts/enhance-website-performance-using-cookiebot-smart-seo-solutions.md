## Solving digital transformation challenges at ABBYY Technology Summit 2017

September 19, 2017

![Solving digital transformation challenges: 5th Annual ABBYY Technology Summit 2017 | ABBYY Blog Post](https://static3.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/25240/8716e_blog-и-smm_abbyy-tech-summit-17blog.png) 

The 5th Annual [ABBYY Technology Summit](https://abbyytechnologysummit.com/) kicks off at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina from 25th\-27th October . Participants will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the engineers behind ABBYY industry leading technologies, network with powerful business leaders, and get hands-on experiences with optional training with the ABBYY technologies and solutions they need to solve their Digital Transformation challenges in 2017 and beyond.

This year’s content-rich [#ABBYYSummit17](https://twitter.com/hashtag/abbyysummit17) event proves once again that the ABBYY Technology Summit is the go-to event for data capture, digital transformation, and natural language processing. Last year’s [#ABBYYSummit16](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ABBYYSummit16) was a remarkable success, drawing our largest crowd yet of 220 business leaders and developers from 15 different countries. In fact, response was so enthusiastic that we were forced to close registration early so [register now](https://abbyytechnologysummit.com/)!

## Coming Up at #ABBYYSummit17

This year’s #ABBYYSummit17 agenda will feature two main keynotes:

* **Capitalizing on Robotics: Driving Savings with Digital Labor - Mike Gough, KPMG**  
   * This keynote session is critical for everyone interested in understanding what enterprises, government agencies, BPOs and shared service centers are thinking as it relates to automating manual and repeatable tasks and moving to a digital labor force. The session will also address the various classes and strategies of going digital and the financial impacts, and will explore common themes to all digital labor projects with an emphasis on three classes of digital labor: basic RPA, enhanced process automation, and cognitive automation.
* **The Evolution and Ultimate Collision of Capture, Content, Context and Analytics: How did we end up here and where are we going? - Martyn Christian, Founder UNDRSTND Group**  
   * Martyn Christian of the UNDRSTND group shares his vision and perspectives on the opportunities driven by market and technology shifts. As a senior executive leader at FileNet, IBM, and Kofax, Martyn has unique insights about how the market has evolved and where the next wave of investments, solutions and opportunities will emerge. This session will not only address historical biases related to capture and recognition, but will also address future opportunities presented by AI, cognitive, text analytics, and digital labor. This session is important for thought leaders seeking to change their own solution and revenue paths for the next wave of innovation.

**Solving Digital Transformation Challenges with Best Practices from ABBYY**

One of the great advantages of this event is the opportunity to directly connect with developers, partners, and customers that use and work with ABBYY technologies every day.

These solution stories, hands-on experiences, and in-depth training sessions are shining examples of how developers and business leaders are working together to take advantage of ABBYY technology in ways that make a real difference today.

Here is what [Bruce Orcutt, SVP of Product Marketing at ABBYY](https://twitter.com/bdorcutt), said about the event:

I’m still inspired after #ABBYYSummit16 in San Diego last year. Unlike some tech industry events that can leave you wanting more substance, our compact format was filled with a variety of presentations, great ideas, exciting solutions, and rare opportunities to learn and interact with some of the leading practitioners in digital transformation today. Response to the event was overwhelming and you could literally feel the growth in both attendance, and event value as 96% of attendees plan on returning this year. We are very excited and look forward to our attendee’s success at #ABBYYSummit17, this October 25th\-27th.
