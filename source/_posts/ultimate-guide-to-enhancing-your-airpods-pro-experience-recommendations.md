## Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Your AirPods Pro Experience - Recommendations

You can use [AirPods Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-airpods-pro/) for a lot -- making phone calls, listening to your favorite music and podcasts, and even receiving text messages. And of course with their upgraded Active Noise Cancellation features, AirPods are a great way to lock in and check out when you need to focus at the gym, in the library, or during work. 

**Also:** [**The best Macs**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/)

However, as convenient as a pair of AirPods Pro may be, they're not perfect. They can fall out of your ears, the battery falls dead with use, and their small size makes them easily susceptible to damage and loss. That's why the best AirPods Pro accessories can protect and compliment their immense functionality. 

The [Multaich Magnetic Straps](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMULTAICH-Magnetic-Anti-Lost-Earphone-Colorful%2Fdp%2FB09DCBZCV6%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C90411c5c-60ad-48a2-8fc8-87e3bd243cba%7Cdtp&dtb=1) are ZDNET's favorite AirPods Pro accessory overall due to their comfortable convenience, but they're not our only choice for accessories to enhance your AirPods. There's no shortage of options available on the market, but these are some of our favorites. If you have a pair of AirPods Pro, these are the best accessories you can buy.
