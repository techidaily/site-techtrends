 The[emoji movement expanded into regular use on all social network sites](https://www.lifewire.com/add-facebook-smileys-to-status-updates-2654604) .

 Apple later introduced[animoji](https://www.lifewire.com/animoji-4153078) , which are animated emoji in 2017\.

## Emoji Are Supported Just About Everywhere

 Using[X on mobile](https://www.lifewire.com/best-mobile-twitter-apps-3486098) devices has always been popular, but until X finally released emoji support on its web version in 2014, those little icons would show up as blank boxes if you visited Twitter.com on a laptop or desktop computer.

 They're not quite identical to the ones you see and type on mobile devices, but they come pretty close, and anything is better than a bunch of boxes filling up your X stream.

 For the record, you can now add[Emoji keyboards to your Android device](https://www.lifewire.com/add-emojis-to-android-4149696) , too. So Android users don't have to suffer through those strange square boxes, either.
