## Accessible ChatGPT Tailored Guidance for All Users

It's safe to say [ChatGPT](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-capture-clarity-editing-insights-for-professional-results/) has made a big impact on the internet. The generative AI chatbot is currently used by millions of people around the world for all kinds of purposes, and it has helped usher in the generative AI era, with a lot of competitors popping up. If you're willing to pay for it, you can take advantage of a lot more features, but one in particular is now making its way to all users, both paid and free.

 OpenAI has announced that custom instructions, a feature that was previously exclusive to [ChatGPT Plus](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) subscribers, is now officially making its way to everyone, regardless of whether they pay for ChatGPT Plus or not. The subscription tier offers many perks, including, notably, support for the newer GPT-4 language model as well as other features such as custom instructions, but the arrival of custom instructions for free users should surely greatly improve the experience of everyone using the chatbot.

 In case you're not familiar with what custom instructions are, they are basically a way for you to simplify your prompts. It allows you to add various requirements and preferences that the chatbot will need to take into account when replying to any prompt you give it. So basically, you can tell it to reply with a specific prompt, or take into account certain details when helping you write a cover letter. You can spell out those details in your prompt, and it'll be pretty much the same thing, but adding them as custom instructions will save you a lot of time, especially if you're planning to use those specific details and instructions frequently and throughout multiple sessions.

 Custom instructions work even if you have chat history turned off in the chatbot. So really, you're not getting a lot of huge new functionality, but your ChatGPT sessions are probably about to get a lot more convenient. If you want to try out custom instructions, just [log into ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), click on your name and select "custom instructions." It might take a while for it to reach everyone, especially if you're using the mobile apps.
