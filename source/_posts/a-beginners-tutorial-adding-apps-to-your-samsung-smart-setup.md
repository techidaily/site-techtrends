## How Do I Find the App Store on My Samsung Smart TV?

 Locating the Samsung app store is simple: Press**Home** on the remote, then select**APPS** .

 The Samsung app store is located on your TV’s home screen (aka, the Smart Hub). It’s integrated directly into the Apps section of the Smart Hub. It's there you can see the apps you already have installed right alongside new apps you don’t have yet.

## How Do I Download New Apps to My Old Samsung Smart TV?

 If you have an older Samsung smart TV connected to the internet, you should still be able to download new apps. However, there are some exceptions. For example,[Netflix is no longer available on some older Samsung TVs](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Ftroubleshooting%2FTSG01203568%2F) . If the app you want isn't supported on your TV, you'll need to use a dedicated[streaming device](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-streaming-device-5208767) like a Fire TV Stick or Roku to access that app.

 Downloading new apps to an old Samsung TV works the same way it does on a newer TV, but you may have to push a**Smart Hub** or**Internet @TV** button on your remote instead of the Home button. From there, you can select**Apps** or**My Apps** to install something.

## How Do I Install Third-Party Apps on My Samsung Smart TV?

Unlike Android-based smart TVs which let you[sideload](https://www.lifewire.com/sideloading-4158932) unofficial apps from third-party sources,[Tizen](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tizen-4580383) \-based Samsung TVs only allow you to download apps from the official app store.

 If you want to use an app that isn’t available on your Samsung TV, you can connect a streaming device that does support the app, like a Chromecast, Roku, or Apple TV.
