## Need to Retract an Email Sent Through Microsoft Outlook? Follow These Easy Steps
### What to Know

* Open the**Sent Items** folder > double-click the message > go to**Recall Message** \>**OK** .
* It's similar in older versions of Outlook, but go to**Message** \>**Actions** \>**Recall This Message** .
* This only works if you both use a Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft 365 account in the same organization.

 This article explains how to recall an email, the requirements for recalling Outlook emails, and potential results and delays that can occur during the process. Instructions in this article apply to all versions of Outlook, including Outlook 2021 through 2007, Outlook 365, New Outlook for Windows, and Outlook on the Web.

## How to Recall Email in Outlook (and Replace It)

 Directions vary slightly between the different versions of Outlook. Below are instructions for recalling an email in the desktop and web versions.

1. Open Outlook and go to the**Sent Items** folder.  
![Sent Items side panel button in Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4BnADBRohOFqzovsge-fHOaPo4U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_recall-a-message-in-outlook-4161319-c7834046614d4d83ac415bb4b7145b8b.jpg)
2. Double-click the sent message you want to recall to open it in a separate window.  
 The options to recall a message are not available when the message is displayed in the Reading Pane.

3. If you're using the latest version of Outlook for Windows or you're on the web version, select**Recall Message** in the toolbar and then choose**OK** . Skip down to Step 7.  
 For older versions of Outlook, go to the**Message** tab, select the**Actions** dropdown arrow, and choose**Recall This Message** .  
 If you don't see those options, select the**three-dot** menu and go to**Actions** \>**Recall This Message** .  
![Recall This Message menu item in Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XnrsAKAkhegnZiJl3-wRh82zXLU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_recall-a-message-in-outlook-4161319-01e67a25438345789124c6cb9f2ef5c9.jpg)
4. In the dialog box, select one of the following:  
   * **Delete unread copies of this message** to recall the message.  
   * **Delete unread copies and replace with a new message** to replace the message with a new one.  
![Recall This Message options in Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fPnPFvwG_oNIeJoMcg0B88xXeBw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_recall-a-message-in-outlook-4161319-23d620dbc44343e0a54f4bafdc93d678.png)  
 Do you want to receive a notification of the results? Tick the box next to **Tell me if recall succeeds or fails for each recipient** .
5. Select**OK** .
6. If you selected**Delete unread copies and replace with a new message** , modify the original message and select**Send** .
7. You'll receive an Outlook notification message regarding the success or failure of your attempt to retract or replace the email.

## Requirements for Recalling an Email Message

 Recalling emails in Outlook comes with some caveats:

* Both you and your recipient must be using a Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Exchange email account in the Outlook app and you must be in the same organization.
* The recipient's mailbox is open when you attempt to process a recall.
* The original message is unread and is in the recipient's Inbox.
* The message was not touched by any process, such as a rule, spam filter, or add-in.

 If any of these requirements are not met, your recall will fail.

## Possible Results When You Recall an Outlook Email

 Depending on the settings of the recipient's email client, whether the original email has already been read, and several other factors, the results of your attempt to recall a message can vary. Following are some of the potential results of an Outlook recall.

* If the recipient has read the message, the recall will fail. Both the original message and the new message (or notification of your attempt to recall the original message) are available to the recipient.
* If the recipient has not opened the original message and opens the recall message first, the original message is deleted. Outlook informs the recipient that you deleted the message from their mailbox.

 These results also occur if the recipient moves both messages to the same folder, either manually or using a rule.

 If the recipient enabled **Automatically process requests and responses to meeting requests and polls** , under**Tracking** , and the recipient has not read the original email, Outlook deletes the original message and informs the recipient that you deleted the message.

 In Outlook 2007, this feature is called**Process requests and responses on arrival** and it under**Tracking Options** .

 However, if the original message is marked as read when the recall message is processed, the recipient is informed that you want to delete the message. The original message remains in the recipient's inbox.

 If the recipient moves the original message out of the inbox and into another folder (manually or using a rule) and the recall message goes to the inbox, the retraction fails regardless of whether either has been read or not. The recipient is informed that a recall attempt failed. The recipient has access to both the original and the new email message.

 In addition, if you use Outlook on a mobile device and attempt to recall a message, the process will likely fail.

## How to Delay Sending Messages

 Sending an incorrect email can be counterproductive and even embarrassing. While Outlook’s recall feature might save you in a pinch, you can alleviate some stress by[scheduling or delaying emails](https://www.lifewire.com/schedule-emails-in-outlook-1173683) . This gives you time to recognize errors or update information before your email lands in your recipient’s inbox.
