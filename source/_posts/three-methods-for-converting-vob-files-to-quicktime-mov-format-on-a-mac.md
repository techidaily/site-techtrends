_I'm trying to convert VOB files into Quicktime. I'm using MPEG Streamclip but it's stuck halfway. Does anyone know the best VOB to QuickTime converter to smoothly convert VOB to QuickTime MOV formats in Mac? Thank you._

**VOB**, short form of "Video Object", is used as a container format in DVD-video media, encoded by MPEG codec. VOB files can be played by VLC, MPlayer, ALLPlayer and more, but QuickTime Player is an exception. Hence, in the event that you hunger for playing VOB files with QuickTime, you're required to primarily convert VOB format to QuickTime MOV on Mac.

To transcode video from VOB to MOV QT format, [**MacX Video Converter Free**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is strongly recommended to decode and re-encode video from VOB MPEG to MOV MPEG-4/H264 format with up to 98% quality kept (thanks to High Quality Engine) and 5X faster speed (GPU Intel QSV/AMD/Nvidia hardware acceleration tech supported), up to 250-320FPS conversion speed.
