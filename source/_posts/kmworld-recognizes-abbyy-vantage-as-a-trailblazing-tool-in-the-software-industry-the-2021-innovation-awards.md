### Looking for a smarter way to automate document processes?

There's a skill for that.

Vantage was developed with a new kind of business worker in mind who is looking for a faster way to consume and leverage data contained within documents, with the notion that data is the fuel that powers businesses and serves customers. The new solutions are specifically dedicated to helping companies unlock the data within their documents and accelerate their business processes—empowering them to work smarter and deliver value to customers when it matters most.

Supplementing Vantage is the ABBYY Marketplace, the first digital marketplace for processing and understanding enterprise documents that provides a rich collection of document skills, connectors, and assets. These enhance and extend the ABBYY Vantage platform and accelerate the digital transformation of organizations of any size, industry, and geography. “[Document Skills](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/),” as we call them, enable intelligent automation platforms, digital workers, and automation robots to intelligently process business documents in a human-like manner—to understand, extract meaning, and make decisions. Skills are a no-code design approach and allow citizen developers to utilize the power of Vantage cognitive services to design and train machine learning models for all types of documents–from invoices and purchase orders to bank statements and loan applications.
