 Batch file is a computer file containing a list of instructions to be carried out in turn.

 For example, you need to constantly run several commands to refresh your network settings, and repeating the same procedure over and over again could be time consuming.

 2) Bear in mind basic commands:

**echo:** The**ON** or**OFF** option for ECHO turns the echoing feature on or off. If the ECHO is on, the CMD will display the command executing.
