##  What's Included on the Roku Channel 

 You can stream the Roku Channel from any Roku device or Roku[ smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681) , of course, in addition to watching it from a web browser or mobile device.

 Roku offers a surprisingly large library of content on the Roku Channel, and most of it is free, whether you have a Roku device or not.

 The channel includes free television programs and a rotating selection of free feature-length movies.

 There's also a limited selection of live TV and live sports. These shows are streamed as they're broadcast, and you don't have the ability to control playback or restart these from the beginning.

 Unfortunately, Roku doesn't include a comprehensive category guide, so you're limited to scanning the categories listed on the website home page or the app's home page. There are over 40 categories in all including: Adventure, Fantasy, Family Night, Mysteries, Drama, Comedy, and more.

 You can also subscribe to premium channels. Roku makes streaming channels available such as Starz, Showtime, HBO, Sundance Now, and the science documentary platform, CuriosityStream.
