##  How to Watch the Star Trek Movies in Chronological Order 

 The_Star Trek_ movies can be separated into three distinct eras. The first era covers the “Prime” timeline started by Gene Roddenberry’s original series from the 1960s and features James T. Kirk and Spock. This era spans six films, beginning with_Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ and ending with_Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ .

 The second era is spun off from_Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and features characters from that TV series. Fittingly, these are known as The Next Generation films. Finally, the Kelvin timeline kicked off with the J.J. Abrams-directed_Star Trek_ in 2009\. This era is an alternate timeline featuring a significantly different history from the “Prime” universe.
