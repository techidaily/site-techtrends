###  What to Know

* All 13 movies were released chronologically.
* Search various streaming platforms to stream the movies by release date.
* Organized by three eras: The Original Series, The Next Generation, and Kelvin Timeline.

 Like[ Star Wars](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-star-wars-movies-in-order-online-5077382) , which is housed on [ Disney+](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-on-disney-4687015) , you can watch all 13 _Star Trek_ movies on a single streaming service.

 This article only covers_Star Trek_ movies that were released theatrically. It doesn’t include TV series like_The Next Generation_ and_Deep Space Nine_ , or canonical adaptations across other media. Although having knowledge of[ The Original Star Trek Series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060028/) and other_Star Trek_ TV series is helpful, it's not essential for enjoying the movies.

##  How to Watch the Star Trek Movies in Chronological Order 

 The_Star Trek_ movies can be separated into three distinct eras. The first era covers the “Prime” timeline started by Gene Roddenberry’s original series from the 1960s and features James T. Kirk and Spock. This era spans six films, beginning with_Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ and ending with_Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ .

 The second era is spun off from_Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and features characters from that TV series. Fittingly, these are known as The Next Generation films. Finally, the Kelvin timeline kicked off with the J.J. Abrams-directed_Star Trek_ in 2009\. This era is an alternate timeline featuring a significantly different history from the “Prime” universe.

| **Movie**                                | **Era**             | **Where to Watch**             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_          | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_        | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek III: The Search For Spock_    | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_          | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_        | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ | The Original Series | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek VII: Generations_             | The Next Generation | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek VIII: First Contact_          | The Next Generation | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek IX: Insurrection_             | The Next Generation | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek X: Nemesis_                   | The Next Generation | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, MGM+ |
| _Star Trek_                              | Kelvin Timeline     | Amazon Prime, Paramount+       |
| _Star Trek Into Darkness_                | Kelvin Timeline     | Amazon Prime, Paramount+       |
| _Star Trek Beyond_                       | Kelvin Timeline     | Amazon Prime, Paramount+, AMC  |

 If you watch all 13_Star Trek_ movies in one sitting, it takes you just over 25 hours. But if you add in the seven TV shows, that time climbs to nearly_25 days_ .
