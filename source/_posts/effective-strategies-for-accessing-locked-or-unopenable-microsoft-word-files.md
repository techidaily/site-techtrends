##  Why Word Is Not Opening Documents 

 It's unusual for Microsoft Word to have trouble opening files, but it does happen. In addition to file corruption, the most likely reason a document doesn't open in Word is that your computer is set up to launch a different program when you open the file. It's also possible that the program needs to be repaired or reinstalled.

##  How to Fix It When a Word Document Won't Open 

 There are a few solutions depending on the problem.

1. [ Change the file association settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-file-associations-in-windows-2624477) to make your documents open in Microsoft Word. Follow these directions if a different program (not MS Word) opens when you double-click a DOCX, DOC, or other document.
2. Use the Open and Repair option. If the document won't open because it's damaged, select the arrow next to the**Open** button and choose**Open and Repair** .

 Files can become corrupted when a computer crashes or loses power, or when a[ USB device](https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039) is disconnected while a document stored on it is open.
3. Restore a previous version of the document. This will work if you use OneDrive or SharePoint and it has a backup of the file from when it was working correctly. To check, right-click the file and go to**Properties** \>**Previous Versions** .
4. Unblock the file. Documents downloaded from the internet might not open correctly in Word. Right-click the file and go to**Properties** \>**Unblock** \>**OK** , and then try to open it again.
5. [ Open Word in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/using-safe-mode-to-diagnose-word-3540220) and then try to open the document from there. If it works, review any add-ins installed in Microsoft Word; one or more might be to blame.
6. [ Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . If Word doesn't launch when you try to open a document, the program might be running in the background, which a reboot will fix.  
 Another way to shut down Word without restarting the PC is via[ Task Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/task-manager-2626025) . If you're comfortable using that tool, find**WINWORD.EXE** in there and kill the task.
7. Repair the program. In Windows 11, go to**Settings** \>**Apps** \>**Installed apps** . Find the Microsoft 365 or Office installation in the list, select the**three dots** , and then go to**Advanced options** \>**Repair** . If that doesn't work, try**Reset** .
8. [ Reinstall Microsoft 365 or Office](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . This is a longer process than the repair you performed in the last step, but it could be necessary to fix the problem.
9. [ Roll back your graphics driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If Word stopped opening documents after you updated your drivers, a bug might be causing a conflict with Word's Protected View settings.
