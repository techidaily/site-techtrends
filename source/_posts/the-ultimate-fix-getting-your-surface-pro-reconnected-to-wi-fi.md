## Waterlogged Woes Be Gone? Testing the Waterproof Claims for iPhone 15 Pro Max
 This article explains the waterproof ability, IP rating, and supporting details for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. We’ll also list precautions you should take to avoid damaging the device, along with step-by-step instructions for drying your iPhone.

## Are iPhones Waterproof?

 To answer this question simply, no,[iPhones are not waterproof](https://www.lifewire.com/is-the-iphone-waterproof-or-not-5089476) . However, most newer iPhone models are water-resistant.

 So, what’s the difference between waterproof and water resistant?

 When it comes to electronics, waterproof means that the device continues to work properly indefinitely when submerged in water. Water resistant means that a device can survive a certain period of time in a particular depth of water, beyond which it won't continue to work.

 Device models since the iPhone 7–including the iPhone 15 line–are water resistant and were tested in a controlled lab to confirm and obtain the rating you’ll see below.

## How Waterproof Is the iPhone 15 Pro Max?

 Several newer iPhone models are more water-resistant than others. The iPhone X through the iPhone 15 models have an IP68 rating under IEC standard 60529, compared to the IP67 rating of the iPhones 7 and 8.

[According to Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108039) , iPhone 15 models, including the iPhone 15 Pro Max, are water resistant for a maximum depth of six meters (approximately 19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes.

 If your iPhone is damaged–for example, if its screen is cracked–it may be less resistant to both water and dust.

## What Is the IP68 Rating?

 IP stands for Ingress Protection, which defines how well the device can resist dust and liquid over time.

 Most modern smartphones have a rating of IP67 or IP68\. The first number after IP represents resistance against solids like dust and ranges from no rating or zero to six. The second number represents resistance against liquids and ranges from no rating or zero to nine.

 The iPhone 15 Pro Max's IP68, therefore, means it has the highest protection against dust and dirt and the second-highest rating for liquids.

[IEC standard 60529](https://keystonecompliance.com/iec-60529/) provides guidelines for protection from solids and liquids to determine the IP rating. For water specifically, this compliance standard includes requirements including dripping, immersion, and direct spraying.

 So, what does all of this mean? The iPhone 15 Pro Max is almost perfect when it comes to water resistance, but it can't withstand major or prolonged exposure.

## Precautions to Take With a Wet iPhone

 Although your iPhone 15 Pro Max is highly water resistant, you should still heed the following precautions to avoid damaging the device and definitely dry the iPhone if it becomes wet:

* [Turn the device off](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-iphone-15-pro-max-8659956) while it dries.
* Do not open the SIM tray until the device is dry.
* Don't dry the device using a heat source, compressed air, or by inserting an object into the connectors.
* Do not charge the device until it’s completely dry.
* Before wireless charging, be sure to wipe the device dry.
* Before charging with a cable or connecting an accessory, allow at least five hours of drying.

 If you[try to charge your device](https://www.lifewire.com/my-iphone-wont-charge-what-do-i-do-2000147) and it senses liquid, you may see an alert such as “Liquid Detected” or “Charging Not Available.”

## How to Dry a Wet iPhone 15 Pro Max

 You may have heard the trick of placing your smartphone in a bag of rice to dry it; however,[Apple advises against this](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102643) as it could damage your device. Instead, follow these steps to[dry the iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-save-wet-iphone-ipod-1999474) .

![iPhone on a cloth](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FsxgvUtkpmiJb35F7ZvcQdWlwoQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iPhone-Towel-Blanket-Chair-8662979-c049d416aab841f992452d1d1aad82e2.jpeg)

1. Wipe the iPhone with a soft, dry, lint-free cloth.
2. Gently tap the device against your hand with the connector facing down to eject excess water.
3. Place your iPhone in a dry space with airflow to dry the connectors.  
 Placing the device near a cool fan can also help dry the connectors.  
 To remove water from the microphone or speaker, place the device on a lint-free cloth with the speaker facing down to allow excess liquid to drip out.

 While Apple doesn’t recommend purposely submerging your iPhone 15 Pro Max, it’s good to know that if the device does end up in the water for a short period of time, you should be able to use it as normal once it dries.
