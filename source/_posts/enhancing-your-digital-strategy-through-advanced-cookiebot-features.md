##### ABBYY recognized for its completeness of vision and ability to execute.

ABBYY for a second time is recognized as a [Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Process Mining Platforms](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). ABBYY’s process intelligence platform, ABBYY Timeline, was the first to highlight the importance of unstructured and semi-structured documents driving processes and is considered a game changer for customers needing to make decisions that are actionable in real time.

ABBYY uniquely provides critical data to process mining and task mining that increases insights into how processes are behaving. Coupled with its comprehensive suite of services including process experts, technical account managers, trainers and a strong partner global ecosystem, customers have reported successfully achieving process optimization. In fact, Gartner estimates that “by 2026, 25% of global enterprises will have embraced process mining platforms as a first step to creating a digital twin for business operations, paving the way to autonomous business operations.” 

ABBYY Process Intelligence has helped us make a real cultural change: to rely on data and make data-driven improvements. The data doesn’t lie. I felt like we were in safe hands being able to leverage the experience ABBYY has had in process mining.

As a result of the company’s strategy and execution, ABBYY process intelligence annual recurring revenue (ARR) [increased 100%](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) in 2023\. Organizations such as [Emerson](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and Société General reported significant operational excellence and cost savings using ABBYY Timeline at the recently held [ABBYY AI Summit](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). Their intelligent automation journeys echo the key drivers noted in the Gartner report to “increase digital transformation efforts, grow process visibility requirements, and increase demand for business operations resilience".
