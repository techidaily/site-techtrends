## How to Get Hulu on an LG Smart TV

 The Hulu app comes preinstalled on most LG smart TVs, so these instructions should work for most models:

 Most LG TVs run the webOS TV operating system, but Roku powers some models (like the LF5700 series), so you'll need to follow the steps to[get Hulu on Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-hulu-on-roku-7483468) .

1. Go to the[Hulu website](https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig%5Freferrer=google.com) to sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. Press the**Home** button on your LG TV remote.
3. In your App List, select the**Hulu** app.
4. Follow the instructions to log in to your Hulu account and start streaming.  
 If you have the Hulu, ESPN+, and Disney Plus bundle, use the same password to log in to all three services.

## How to Install the Hulu App

 If you don't see Hulu in your App List, you can install it from the LG store:

1. Press the**Home** button on your LG TV remote.
2. In your App List, select**Apps** or**LG Content Store** on older LG TVs.
3. Select the**Search** icon at the top of the screen, then search for**Hulu** .  
 If you don't see Hulu in the search results, your LG TV doesn't support the Hulu app, so you'll have to use a different method.

 On some models, you'll be prompted to log in to your LG account before adding or updating apps.
5. Select**Launch** to open the Hulu app and follow the instructions to start streaming.

## Which LG TVs Support Hulu?

 All LG smart TVs that run webOS 3.5 or higher come with the Hulu app already installed. Most LG TVs running webOS 3.0 support Hulu except for the B6, UH6350, UH6330, UH77, UH76, and UH61 series.

 Your model or serial number can be found on the back of your TV. On some LG TVs, you can bring up model information by pressing the**Mute** button on the remote three times.  

 If[Hulu isn't working](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hulu-not-working-5096089) on your LG TV, delete and reinstall the app to ensure you have the latest version.

## Other Ways to Watch Hulu on an LG TV

 Other ways to[watch Hulu on a TV](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-hulu-on-your-tv-3486665) include hooking up your computer to the TV or connecting a streaming device like a Google Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire Stick. Game consoles like the Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch all have the Hulu app so that you can watch on your LG TV that way, too.
