## Installing Microsoft's New Copilot Across All Devices: A Step-by-Step Guide

Windows 11 24H2 has a new Copilot interface, designed to be used in a larger window instead of a side panel on your desktop. You can actually use it on any device or web browser, though.

 Microsoft already has a web app version of its Copilot AI chat assistant, available at [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) in the web browser. Windows 10 and Windows 11 had Copilot in a sidebar on the desktop, but starting with Windows 11 24H2, [Copilot is now just a web app](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigate-the-world-of-games-top-12-pc-clickers-revealed/) that runs in a regular application window. The new Windows Copilot looks different than the existing web app, though.

 The custom web app more closely mirrors the Fluent UI used in other Windows 11 applications. Your previous conversations are listed in the left sidebar, which collapses when you shrink the window. The new Windows Copilot feels a lot more polished than the standard web app, with more fluid animations. It’s not clear why Microsoft won’t just make the new Windows Copilot the regular Copilot web app, but maybe that will happen eventually.

 There’s both a light and dark mode in the Copilot web app, as well as the option to synchronize with your device’s current theme. You can click the profile icon at the top-right corner and select ‘Appearance’ to change the visual theme.

##  How to Get Windows Copilot

 You can try out the new Copilot web app from Windows 11 24H2 in any web browser, by navigating to the below address:

https://copilot.microsoft.com/?dpwa=1

 That opens the Copilot web app with the same interface as the Copilot shortcut in Windows 11 24H2\. You can then [“install” it with Google Chrome](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-battlefield-2042-from-crashing-on-your-gaming-pc/) or other Chromium-based browsers to make it a desktop shortcut, exactly like it is on Windows 11\. Safari on Mac has [a similar “Add to Dock” feature](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/quick-setup-for-hp-officejet-n5740-download-compatible-drivers-here/).

 The web app seems to work in any web browser, though I noticed in Firefox, the placeholder text doesn’t automatically clear when you select it. On Windows 11 24H2, the web app runs in a Microsoft Edge container, so it will work best in Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Vivaldi.

 Make sure to log in with a Microsoft account after opening the Copilot web app, so you get access to longer conversations and other features.
