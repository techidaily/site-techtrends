 Once selected, the "Reset This PC" window will appear. You'll have two options to choose from:

* **Keep my files:** This option will keep all of your personal files while removing installed apps and system settings.
* **Remove everything:** This will completely wipe your Windows 10 PC.

 Choose the option that works best for you.

 The next screen presents you with the choice between a local reinstall and a cloud download. Local reinstall uses existing assets on your PC to rebuild a clean copy of Windows, while cloud download fetches a new copy of Windows 10 from Microsoft. You can use whichever you prefer, just keep in mind that the cloud install will use about four gigabytes of data. That could be important if you're on a metered network or have slow Internet.

![Select 'Cloud Download' or 'Local Reinstall.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-cloud-dl-or-local.jpg)
