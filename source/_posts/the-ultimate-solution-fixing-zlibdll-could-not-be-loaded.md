## The Ultimate Solution: Fixing 'zlib.dll Could Not Be Loaded'
 The zlib.dll file is associated with the[zlib](https://zlib.net/) compression library, specifically zlib-1.1.4 or earlier (later versions use zlib1.dll). This is why it's common to see zlib.dll files while opening, using, installing, or uninstalling video games and applications that use this software library.

 The context of the zlib.dll error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.  

 The zlib.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) including [Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Zlib.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download zlib.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of zlib.dll, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore zlib.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" zlib.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted zlib.dll but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to[recover zlib.dll with a free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Download zlib.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/malmo/files/5758471/zlib.zip) and then extract zlib.dll file from it. This is a trusted download from Microsoft's GitHub (the download will start immediately after clicking that link).
3. [Run the program with administrative rights](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/run-as-admin) . It's possible that the zlib.dll error is being thrown because the file needs permissions to run that the current user can't provide. We've seen zlib.dll errors fixed this way for PC video games.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some zlib.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the zlib.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the zlib.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Reinstall the program that uses the zlib.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the zlib.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the zlib.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
7. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to zlib.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file zlib.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The zlib.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
8. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if zlib.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The zlib.dll file is probably not included in one of these updates but a Windows update might be needed in order for the zlib.dll file to work.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause zlib.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests, replace the memory or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual zlib.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair zlib.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid zlib.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included as an option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This erases everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and installs a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the zlib.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the zlib.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any zlib.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of How to Fix Zlib.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 Zlib.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the zlib [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, zlib.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 There are several ways zlib.dll errors can show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common error messages you might see:

* **Zlib.dll Not Found**
