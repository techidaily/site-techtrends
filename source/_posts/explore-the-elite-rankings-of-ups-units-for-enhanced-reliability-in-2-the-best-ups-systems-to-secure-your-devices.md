[Our Review of Google Voice](https://www.lifewire.com/google-voice-review-3426683)

 Google Voice has offered visual voicemail for longer than most of the competition. Before Google acquired Google Voice, it was known as Grand Central. Whether you use iPhone or Android, Google Voice is the best free visual voicemail app out there today.

 Google Voice gives you a dedicated, free phone number you can set to ring (or not) on any device you choose. When a new voicemail message arrives, Google Voice sends a transcription right away by email, text, or both.

## [The Best Visual Voicemail App for One-Stop Shopping: InstaVoice](https://instavoice.com/)

 What We Like

* Visual voicemail for up to ten phone numbers.
* Access and handle voicemail in one place.
* Helpful customer support.

 What We Don't Like

* Not as many features as competitors.

 InstaVoice provides visual voicemail transcription, but with a twist. It aims to provide a single interface to manage an unlimited number of voice messages from every phone number you want.

 If you get a ton of voicemail messages on a regular basis, to the point that people tell you they got the dreaded "the mailbox is full" message when calling you, this is the app for you.

 In addition to accessing voice-to-text transcriptions on the spot, you can also call or text the person who left a message by using a chat-like interface within InstaVoice. It's a great way to maintain a large volume of voicemails across multiple phone numbers, handling them with the same speed and efficiency you would a text message or email.

**Download For** :

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/instavoice-messenger/id821541731)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirusa.instavoice)
