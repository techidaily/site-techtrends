You can tell ExpressVPN to scan its entire network and measure server speeds for each server. It has servers located in 105 countries, which is more than most VPNs, so you'll have plenty of options.

We've also found it to be an excellent option for accessing streaming services.

It's one of the most popular VPN providers, offering a wide range of platforms, and it's a well-regarded, trusted service. ExpressVPN is compatible with macOS 10.13 or later and iOS 15 or later, as well as Windows, Android, Linux, tvOS, and Amazon operating systems.

Proton VPN has a range of security options and utilizes strong protocols for enhanced security. As we'd expect from a security-conscious VPN, Proton VPN provides a kill switch, as well as servers in 91 countries, P2P support, Tor over VPN, and obfuscation, among other features.

As a bonus, Proton VPN apps are open-source, which allows anyone to examine their code. The company reports that it is independently audited and has a no-logs policy. This VPN is compatible with macOS 10.12 and above.

## What is a Mac VPN service and why should you use one?

Our laptops, together with our mobile phones, are now lifelines to day-to-day services, entertainment, communication, and work.

With the right VPN, you can browse the internet more anonymously, access geo-restricted content, and avoid being tracked by advertisers, hackers, and governments. Also, if you are on a remote or hybrid schedule, employers may require you to use a VPN (or set up one based on their own preferred service).

**See also: [What is a VPN and why do you need one?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-and-why-do-you-need-one-all-your-virtual-private-network-questions-answered/)**

A Mac VPN service is a virtual private network service that encrypts your internet traffic, hides your IP address, and provides you with an anonymous and secure connection while you're online. 

While macOS is well-known for being less susceptible to malware and cyberthreats than Windows, the OS alone can't stop you from being monitored online, which is why you should consider investing in a service that does.

## What about split tunneling?

Enabling split tunneling features allows you to route some traffic through a protected, encrypted VPN tunnel, while allowing other traffic to bypass the VPN and go directly to its destination.

Split tunneling is a common feature of VPNs, but in the Apple ecosystem it seldom works well. Apple often changes MacOS libraries, making Mac-friendly split tunneling a challenge to develop. 

## How to set up a VPN on Mac

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

When you're ready to try out a new VPN on your Mac, first download the VPN service you want from Apple's App Store. Then, run the installer. You may need to provide permission for the installation software to finish.

For this example, we are installing ExpressVPN on a MacBook Pro.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Next, sign in using your VPN account credentials or through a device authorization code. Your VPN should now be active, and you can select the country server you want, change any further settings, and more.

## How we test Mac VPNs

The many VPN providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of the ZDNET team. We've been talking about VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, every community, every local ISP, and every nation has a different infrastructure. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for macOS using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you'd need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point using a VPN if its security protocols and encryption levels aren't up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cares about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN to have, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you're streaming.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our VPN recommendations, naturally, have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive mobile apps.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.

For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive [VPN testing methodology page](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-and-review-vpns/).

## What are the factors to consider when choosing a Mac VPN?

When you are selecting your new Mac VPN, you need to consider the following factors:

* **Price**: You need to consider the overall cost of your new VPN plan. Try to take advantage of promotions, but ignore countdown timers -- they typically are just marketing tools. While top-notch VPNs can cost upwards of $10/month, many are available for only a few dollars. Many VPN providers also give you a free seven-day iOS or iPadOS trial. We generally recommend that you avoid free VPNs -- with a few exceptions -- as they may sell your data or bombard you with ads.
* **Simultaneous connections**: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your Mac, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as on an iPhone. We recommend you sign up for a plan with support for at least six devices. Thankfully, many paid VPN plans now offer unlimited connections.
* **Streaming:** If you intend to use your Mac VPN for streaming content, make sure that the VPN is able to accommodate your favorite services. It can be a cat-and-mouse game -- especially if you're away from home -- so it's worth researching whether your VPN has issues with accessing specific streaming services.
* **Contract length**: You also need to decide how long you want a VPN for. If you opt for a two-year term, you tend to secure the best prices, but there are other options available. After you've made a selection, you typically have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
* **Apps and extensions**: When selecting a VPN, you might want to try out its accompanying mobile apps and extensions to ensure you're getting the most out of your subscription. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software, but the mobile app may not be as easy to use.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Does macOS have a built-in VPN?

Macs do not have built-in VPNs, but the operating system does support the use of one through various protocols. It does, however, offer Apple Private Relay.

## Is Apple Private Relay a VPN?

Functionally, [Apple Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph499d287c2/ios) does act similarly to a VPN. As Apple explains, "When iCloud Private Relay is on, the traffic leaving your iPhone is encrypted and sent through two separate internet relays. This prevents websites from seeing your IP address and exact location while preventing network providers from collecting your browsing activity in Safari."

Apple Private Relay is, however, limited to Safari and is not available in all countries or regions. It will mask your IP address, though.

## Do you even need a VPN on a Mac?

MacOS is often considered more secure than Windows. By virtue of both the smaller number of units sold (making it a less juicy target for hackers) and Apple's tight hardware-software integration, macOS is somewhat more secure than Windows. That means less malware runs on Macs.

That said, a VPN isn't primarily used to protect against malware. You use a VPN to protect the data you transmit and receive, in addition to preventing your location from being determined by your site visits.

So, yes, you need a VPN on a Mac if you want to protect your communications and current location.

## What's the best VPN for my iPhone or iPad?

In general, if a VPN service has invested heavily in making a great product for macOS devices, it'll often have solid offerings for iOS and iPadOS. This is why our [best VPNs for iPhone and iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/) list is similar to our best Mac VPNs list. At the moment, we consider NordVPN to be the top choice.

If you want a VPN for Apple mobile devices and desktops or laptops, then the services we've highlighted here should meet your needs.

## Are there free VPNs for Macs?

There are a number of [free VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) that are compatible with Apple devices, but if you opt for free options, be aware of the limitations.

With free VPNs, you run the risk of using a service that doesn't have the resources, or intention, to keep your data secure and private. It costs money to develop and run a VPN service. If you're not paying, then the company needs to find another source of revenue. This could be through ads, or via less reputable providers, by selling your data.

There are reputable VPN services we recommend that have a free version of the paid service. There are also practical issues. The free version of the VPN may be just as secure as the paid service, but the performance is often limited, so the service becomes impractical for real-world use on a daily basis. Many of these free VPNs have data and speed restrictions.

If you find these limits acceptable, we recommend trying out Proton VPN's free plan, or alternatively, Windscribe.

## How do I tell if my Mac VPN is safe?

To check if your VPN is safe and working properly, first choose a reputable vendor known to have a strong security background.

The easiest way to check that your VPN is working properly is to compare your IP address before and after enabling a VPN connection. You can find this easily by visiting [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/). If they both display the same IP, your VPN may not be working properly. 

You can also visit [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) to check for DNS leaks while you are using a VPN, which could be a sign that your information is being leaked.

Finally, be careful with free VPNs being offered by unknown or shady companies, especially if they are outside of Apple's App Store. Apple is known for its stringent controls of third-party apps but executing unknown software could still open your device up to surveillance or malware.
