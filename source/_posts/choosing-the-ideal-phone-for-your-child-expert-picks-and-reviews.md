You may think that giving your kids a [phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) isn't a good idea (until at least a certain age), but let's face it: we live in a technology-driven world and our kids are growing up with tech devices more early on.

And while the decision to get your kid a phone can be complicated, we've broken it down for you.

### Best phone for kids overall

Apple's iPhone lineup spans a wide range of models at varying prices. The most inexpensive iPhone is the iPhone SE, which starts at $429\. Apple revamped the iPhone SE in 2022 with the same processor as the more expensive iPhone 13 lineup. I went hands-on with the iPhone SE, and the end result was an iPhone 13-like experience in a phone that's half the price. 

The phone features a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID home button that your child can use to secure their iPhone with a fingerprint. The rear camera takes photos that are nearly as clear and crisp as higher-end iPhones, while the front camera provides a solid FaceTime experience. 

**Review:** [**Apple iPhone SE: You simply can't find a better phone at this price**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/)

In addition to excellent hardware at a reasonable price, you're also getting access to Screen Time parental controls, Find My, Family Sharing, and the rest of Apple's software services. For a family that's heavily invested in Apple products, the iPhone SE is a great starter phone for kids. 

[Parents on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/z24y4x/phones%5Ffor%5Fa%5Fkid%5Fage%5F11parental%5Fcontrols/) who purchased the iPhone SE for their child praised the parental control options and how easy the phone is to use for young kids. 

**Apple iPhone SE tech specs: Display:** 4.7-inch | **Processor:** Apple A15 Bionic | **Memory:** 4GB | **Storage:** 64/128/256GB | **Rear cameras:** 12MP | **Front camera:** 7MP FaceTime Camera | **Battery:** 2,018 mAh | **Cost:** Around $429

### Best starter phone for kids

The [Moto G Pure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/moto-g-pure-brings-mediatek-processor-to-us-with-159-99-device/) is an incredibly affordable phone that offers a basic experience. It's often on sale from the retail price of $100, which makes it a good starter phone for children learning how to take care of a device for the first time.

In fact, both of my kids started with a Moto G model in order to prove they could take care of a phone without breaking, losing, or leaving it somewhere it could be stolen. The Moto G Pure has a decent camera setup, 3.5mm headphone jack, large battery (helpful for kids who love playing games), and large display, 

However, there are two potential downsides to the G Pure: Storage and speed. With 32GB of internal storage, you'll want to add a 512GB microSD card to make room for pictures, videos, apps and games. 

Performance will be slower than what you'd find on an iPhone and other phones on this list. However, verified customers on Amazon said that for a kids phone, the performance, battery life, and value is good enough as a starter phone.

**Moto G Pure tech specs: Display:** 6.5-inch | **Processor:** MediaTek Helio G25 | **Memory:** 3GB | **Storage:** 32GB, microSD card support | **Rear cameras:** 13MP, 2MP, depth sensor | **Front camera:** 5MP | **Battery:** 4,000 mAh | **Cost:** Around $159

Pros

Cons 
* Limited internal storage

## Samsung Galaxy A32 5G

### Best kids' phone for Samsung families

Samsung isn't known for low-end smartphones. But since LG recently exited the smartphone business, Samsung has begun to improve and iterate its entry-level phones. 

**Also: [The 5 best Samsung phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/)**

The Samsung Galaxy A32 5G looks and works just like a high-end Galaxy S22, but it only costs $160\. It also features a 5,000 mAh battery, which is powerful enough to survive a full day of use for most people (even kids). Plus, verified customers say that the 48-megapixel camera and rear-facing cameras are solid. 

With only 64GB of internal storage, you'll want to add more using the built-in microSD card slot that allows up to 1TB of additional storage. 

**Samsung Galaxy A32 5G tech specs: Display:** 6.5 inches, 90Hz | **Processor:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 | **Memory:** 4GB | **Storage:** 64GB, with microSD support | **Rear cameras:** 48MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 5MP macro, and 2MP depth sensor | **Front camera:** 13MP camera | **Battery:** 5,000 mAh | **Cost:** Around $160

### Best budget phone for kids

The Gabb Phone 3 Pro was made specifically with kids in mind, and it has kids-centric features parents will approve of. These include 100 Gabb-reviewed, parent-managed apps (but no social media or internet), clean music streaming from Gabb Music, and Gabb Messenger, which filters text messages for safer communication. Other third-party apps can be additionally downloaded, but app downloads are entirely controlled by the parent. 

Through the phone's GPS tracking, parents can also create "Safe Zones" where they can be notified when their child leaves or enters a designated area.

Parents say that on the outside, it still looks and feels like a "grown-up" smartphone, with specs like a 6.6-inch Infinity-V display, Quad Core camera with wide, ultra-wide, macro, & depth lenses, and crisp 1080p@30fps video capture. 

The Gabb Phone 3 Pro uses the Verizon network and an Android OS.

**Gabb Phone 3 Pro tech specs:** **Display:** 6.6-inch | **Processor:** Octa-Core 4x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55 & 4x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55 processor | **Memory:** 3GB | **Storage:** 32GB | **Rear cameras:** Quad Core camera with wide (50MP), ultrawide (5MP), macro (2MP), and depth (2MP) lenses:| **Battery:** 5000mAh battery | **Cost:** $100

## Google Pixel 6a 5G

### Best secure phone for kids

The Google Pixel 6a is one of the most secure phones you can buy for your child. The Google Tensor processor's security core works with the Titan M2 security chip to make the phone resistant to hacking, tracking, and spying. 

**Review: [Google Pixel 6a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-6a-review/)**

I went hands-on with this device and found that your phone doesn't need to have the best parts and pieces to provide the best experience. In my mind, the 6a is nearly identical to the 6 Pro. 

It also uses a fingerprint reader to unlock, so only you, your child, and authorized users can access the phone for calls and texts. The phone is also IP67 rated for water- and dust-resistance. One [Reddit user noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/110mwc2/just%5Fbought%5Fmy%5Fkid%5Fa%5F6a%5Fim%5Fa%5F7%5Fpro%5Fowner%5Fquick/), "The great thing about the 6a for a kid is it is basically immune to rain and even accidentally being thrown into a pool."

With a 24-hour battery life and quick-charging feature, you can stay in touch with your kid all day. 

**Google Pixel 6a 5G t** **ech specs: Display:** 6.1-inch | **Processor:** Google Tensor | **Memory:** 6GB | **Storage:** 128GB | **Rear cameras:** 12MP wide, 12MP ultrawide | **Front camera:** 8MP | **Battery:** 24 hours | **Cost:** $349

Pros 
* Calls and texts only
* Content monitoring technology
* No contract required

Cons 
* Parent app is glitchy
* Complaints about customer service

### Best phone for younger kids

The Bark Phone looks and feels like a real smartphone (a Samsung Galaxy A13, to be exact), but it is perfect for younger kids thanks to the advanced parental content monitoring features, GPS location tracking, and more. Plus, the starter plan comes with no apps, no browsers, and no social media, so your child is just using the text and call features of the phone.

Parents can approve or deny contacts on the phone so you know who your child is messaging with, and the phone even scans texts and sends you alerts for potential issues within any messages. One [Reddit user noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/parenting%5Ftech/comments/t2raup/bark%5Fapp/) that the alerts feature is big plus, since it lets you know if there's anything concerning without having to constantly check in. 

As your child grows older, you can easily upgrade to the advanced plan and add in access to apps and games while keeping the same phone and the advanced monitoring features.

**Bark Phone** **tech specs: Display:** 6.6-inch | **Processor:** Octa core (2.2Ghz + 2.0Ghz) | **Memory:** 4GB | **Storage:** 64GB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP | **Front camera:** 13MP | **Battery:** 5,000mAh | **Cost:** Starting at $39/mo

## Which is the right phone for your kid?

Deciding which phone is right for your kid depends on a few factors, including age, overall cost, and which operating system you prefer. Once you know those details, you can narrow down your search and make a choice based on personal preference. 

| **Choose this kids' phone…** | **If you want…**                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apple iPhone SE              | The best all-around kids phone that will be supported for years and it features a good camera and excellent battery life.                    |
| Moto G Pure                  | A budget-friendly starter phone for children that's affordable, has a large display, and a good battery.                                     |
| Samsung Galaxy A32 5G        | A good mix of affordability and performance for parents with a solid battery life your kids will love.                                       |
| Gabb Phone 3 Pro             | A budget-friendly smartphone. It comes with parent-approved apps and parental controls, and doesn't allow social media or internet browsing. |
| Google Pixel 6a 5G           | A secure phone with great cameras, quick charge capabilities, and a solid battery life.                                                      |
| Bark Phone                   | A phone for littler kids. It only allows calls and texts and has advanced content monitoring and parental controls.                          |

## Factors to consider when choosing a phone for your kid:

Buying a device for your child is much different than buying a device for yourself. Be sure to consider the following factors before making your final purchase. 

* **Privacy:** Keeping your child's information and data is of the utmost importance with any tech device, so choose a phone with privacy features like encryption and parental controls so you can contact your child if need be.
* **Battery life:** A phone serves little purpose if it's out of battery, so look at devices with long battery lives so you don't have to constantly recharge.
* **Price:** These days, smartphones can range dramatically in price. Since this will likely be your child's first phone and they simply need something more basic, find something more affordable.

## How did we test these phones for kids?

I've reviewed phones for more than a decade. Not only have I tested these devices myself, but I've experienced my own kids reaching the age of needing their first phone. All five of these picks are something I would (and have) trust(ed) my kids to take care of. 

ZDNET does extensive hands-on testing of phones, including ease of use, and paying attention to specs like display, battery life, and overall experience while using the phone. For products we recommend, we write a product spotlight review that we update periodically with new features and pricing information.

For the phones we have not gone hands-on with, we do extensive research into different products and brands, taking into consideration user reviews (both good and bad), competitor analysis, and more.

## What about parental controls for a kids phone?

Both Apple and Google have their own respective solutions for adding parental controls to an iPhone or Android phone. For iPhone users, you'll want to enable [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982) on your child's phone. For Android phones, you can set up [Google's Family Link](https://families.google.com/familylink/). 

**Also: [The 5 best parental control apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-parental-control-apps/)**

Both options offer you control to schedule when the phone can and can't be used, which apps can be installed, and even who the child can talk to. 

## What's the best cellular plan for a kid?

Sticking with your current carrier and adding a line to your account is going to get you the best deal on a new phone. However, if you want to buy a phone outright without getting locked into device payments, you can always start with a prepaid carrier like Republic Wireless or Visible. The plans are cheap, and you're not committed to paying the carrier back for a phone if your child loses it. 

If you opt to add a line to your account, most carriers allow you to mix and match plans. For example, you can have your number on a plan that allows unlimited data usage at full speed, and then give your child a plan that forfeits data speed when the network is busy. It saves you money while still giving your child access to everything they need a phone to do. 

## Are there apps built in to keep track of my kid's location?

Yes! If you set up Screen Time on an iPhone, you'll also set up Apple's Family Share feature that includes Find My. Find My is not only what you use to track down a lost iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but it's also used to keep tabs on friends or loved ones. 

Google Family Link offers the same functionality, or you can add your child to Google Maps' Location Sharing feature.

## Are there alternative phones for kids worth considering?

Of course! There are countless phones for children available. From [refurbished iPhones to used devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-old-phone/) off of Swappa, or a similar second-hand website. The [iPhone 12](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-12/) is the oldest device currently sold by Apple, but it's $599 and comes with an older processor and arguably a worse camera than the iPhone SE. However, it has a larger display, Face ID and comes in tons of colors. 

As for [Android devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/), well, you really have your pick of the sea. From well-known brands like Samsung and Motorola to lesser-known device makers like TCL and OnePlus, the list of phones that are worth considering is long. 

As for [smartwatches](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/) that replicate a phone-like experience, Verizon's GizmoWatch 2 is also a respectable option.
