##  How to Delete Your TikTok Account

 Before you move forward with deleting your account, be warned that you'll lose all of your TikTok data, including your videos. Plus, if you purchased items inside the app, you won't receive a refund.

 If you wish to save your video content from TikTok prior to deleting your account, choose a video, tap the**three dots** icon, then tap**Save Video** . The video will be saved to your device.

 Once you're ready to delete your TikTok account, it only takes a few steps to make it happen.

1. Open the TikTok app, then tap the**profile** icon, which looks like the outline of a person, in the bottom corner of your screen.
2. Tap the**three dots** in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.
3. Tap**Manage My Account** \>**Delete Account** .
4. For verification purposes, you may be asked to verify your identity by logging into your Facebook or X (formerly Twitter) account. If needed, tap**Verify and Continue** to move forward.
5. A confirmation screen will appear. If you wish to move forward with deleting your account, tap**Delete Account** .
