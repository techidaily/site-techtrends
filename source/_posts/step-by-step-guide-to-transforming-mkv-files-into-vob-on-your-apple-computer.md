| 1\. Competent to convert MKV to VOB, Blu-ray, AVCHD, MTS and M2TS. 2\. The remux of MKV files to VOB files without transcoding or recompression involved so that the speed is definitely untrafast and the output quality is good. 3\. Neat and user-friendly interface. 4\. File splitting capabilities. | 1\. Lack of a comprehensive "Help" file.  2\. The interface fails to be resized or set to stay "always on top". 3\.
