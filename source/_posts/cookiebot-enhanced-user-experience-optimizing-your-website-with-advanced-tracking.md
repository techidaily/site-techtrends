ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligent solutions and services, today announced the extension of its partnership with Lifeboat Distribution®, a value added distributor, providing supply chain services and connecting best-in-breed software publishers with resellers around the globe. The company will now distribute ABBYY FineReader and ABBYY Recognition Server in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. 

The new agreement extends the partnership between the two companies signed earlier this year, which covered the distribution of ABBYY FineReader and Recognition Server by Lifeboat in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

“Our initial offering of FineReader and Recognition Server throughout North America was met with great success, and we quickly realized the need to expand our agreement with ABBYY to include the Benelux regions. ABBYY addresses a growing need for comprehensive, powerful OCR and PDF solutions and together, we are able to deliver the best value to the market”, comments Ruud van Noort, Managing Director at Lifeboat Europe.

“We are happy to extend our partnership with Lifeboat Distribution to Benelux. Organizations worldwide can use ABBYY FineReader and Recognition Server to enhance employee efficiencies and improve knowledge workers’ experience while supporting their digital transformation initiatives”, adds Kristin Wagener, Senior Director, Application Software Sales at ABBYY.

FineReader and Recognition Server are an important part of ABBYY’s comprehensive portfolio of tools that simplify digitization, capture and extraction of data. ABBYY FineReader is a powerful PDF editing application with underlying OCR capabilities of exceptional accuracy, for increasing business productivity when working with documents. It provides versatile easy-to-use tools to access and modify information locked in PDF documents and scans.

ABBYY Recognition Server is a document conversion server that automatically converts paper, image and electronic documents and saves them as compressed archive compliant files, such as PDF or PDF/A. It helps organizations of any size optimize business processes while also achieving compliance, collaboration and long-term storage goals.
