## Part 2\. How to Transfer and Play DVD Videos on Apple TV

After you digitize your DVD collection to Apple TV supported MP4 or MOV format, you can now import DVD content to Apple TV library for later playback. There are 4 ways that let you play the converted DVD videos on Apple TV, including AirPlay, Home Sharing, VLC and DLNA. Check them out:

### 1\. For Mac only: play DVD video on Apple TV via AirPlay 

As the protected DVD is converted into a DRM-free video for Apple TV, you can now mirror your desktop or laptop screen from your Mac system to an Apple TV using Airplay. 

Note: AirPlay only supports DVD playback on Mac computers. It does not work directly with Apple TV. And the DVD playback quality on the Apple TV may depend on your Wi-Fi network speed and stability.

**Step 1.** Connect your Mac and Apple TV to the same network. Then enable your Apple TV and set your television to the right input for Apple TV. Then you should see the home screen of Apple TV.

**Step 2.** On macOS Ventura, Monterey, and Big Sur, click the Control Center icon > choose Screen Mirroring, and select Apple TV or the name of your smart TV. On earlier macOS, simply click on the AirPlay status icon and select the Apple TV or AirPlay-compatible TV.

Then you can play the DVD video on Apple TV via your Mac. 

![Add DVD movies for playback on Apple TV](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/airplay-appletv.jpg) 

_Note: For homemade DVDs, you may watch them on Apple TV using AirPlay. However, you can use Apple DVD player to AirPlay a homemade DVD to Apple TV as it blocks all content from being airplayed. If you are playing a home made DVD on Apple TV using AirPlay, you might use VLC or similar rather than the Apple DVD software._ 

**AirPlay Mirroring Requirements:**

* Apple TV 2 or later; Mac OS X 10.8 or higher;
* Mac computer models: iMac (Mid 2011 or newer), Mac mini (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), and MacBook Pro (Early 2011 or newer).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 2\. For Mac and PC: import DVDs into Apple TV Library via Home Sharing 

Another way to play DVD movies on Apple TV is Home Sharing. In this method, you need to make sure your computer and Apple TV are signed in with the same Apple ID and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 

* Note: Home Sharing requires iTunes and the DVD playback feature enabled on your Mac. It allows you to access your Mac's DVD library directly from your Apple TV.

**Step 1:** Import the converted DVD movie to your Apple TV library or iTunes library. On macOS later than Catalina, click the Apple TV app on your Mac, select File > Import. Locate the converted DVD movie on your Mac and click Open. On Windows and earlier macOS, open the iTunes app, choose File > Add File to Library or Add Folder to Library. Then locate the converted DVD movie on your PC and click Open. 

![Add DVD movies for playback on Apple TV](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/add-movie-to-itunes.jpg) 

**Step 2.** On your Apple TV, go to Settings > Users and Accounts > and then select Home Sharing. Enable Home Sharing and sign in with your Apple ID.

**Step 3.** The next steps are a bit different on macOS and Windows. 

On macOS later than Catalina, choose Choose Apple menu on your Mac > System Preferences. Click Sharing > Media Sharing.

On Windows and earlier macOS, open iTunes for Windows on your PC. In the menu bar, go to File > Home Sharing.

![Play DVD on Apple TV via Home Sharing](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/home-sharing.jpg) 

**Step 4.** Next, you can open the Computer App on your Apple TV screen and access the DVD movie from the shared library. Then you can watch the movies added to your library on your Apple TV.

### 3\. For Mac and PC: Stream DVD to Apple TV via VLC

You can also play ripped DVDs on Apple TV using a media server like Plex or VLC media player. Take VLC as an example. VLC for Apple TV offers three basic ways to get VLC on Apple TV to play DVD videos on Apple TV: Local Network, Remote Playback or Network Stream. You will need a web browser for the second method, and a web or FTP server for the third. Let's take a look at each in order.

Note: when you stream the DVD to Apple TV via a media server, it's important to have a stable and fast internet connection. This ensures smooth streaming without buffering or interruptions.

**Local Network**

VLC is able to stream the ripped DVD movie to Apple TV from your local network. It requires a media server, wether it's a DLNA/UPnP media server, FTP server, Plex server, or Windows Share. Simply transfer the ripped DVD videos to the server > select Local Network on the VLC for Apple TV and find your server > browse and select the movie stored in the server and then you can play DVDs on Apple TV.

![playing DVD to Apple TV via VLC](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-apple-tv.jpg) 

**Remote Playback**

VLC for Apple TV offers another easy way to watch DVD movies on Apple TV from your PC/MAC/iOS: Remote Playback. Here are the steps:

1\. Open VLC on Apple TV and choose Remote Playback. Click on the Enable Remote Playback button.

2\. Then you will see two URLs on the screen: one is your IP address and the other is your local network address. Enter either URL into the web browser on your PC/Mac, then drag and drop the ripped DVD movie into the screen. After a quick load, you should be able to play the DVD video on your Apple TV. 

![Watch DVD to Apple TV via VLC](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-remote-playback.jpg) 

**Network Stream**

The Network Stream feature lets you play DVDs on Apple TV if you store the ripped DVD movies in Dropbox, Google Drive, web servers, and FTP servers on the internet. Simply enter the URL of the cloud address of the DVD video in the Network Stream tab, then it will play on Apple TV.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 4\. For Mac and PC: Stream DVD Content to Apple TV via DLNA

If your computer has [**5KPlayer**](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) already installed, just rely on 5KPlayer DLNA tech to cast DVD content from Mac/PC to Apple TV. 5KPlayer is a nice blend of DLNA controller, DLNA renderer and DLNA server. It can activate DLNA tech to cast H.264/MP4 media file from Mac/PC to Apple TV, smart TV, as well as PlayStation, Xbox, etc. (of course, you get DVD ripped by HandBrake or MacX DVD Ripper Pro already).

 By the way, this HD video player supports playing 4K/5K/8K UHD videos with multi-subtitle tracks and soundtracks, YouTube videos, HD Camcorder, Blu-ray videos and more. Apparently, playing DVD on Apple TV is a piece of cake now. Follow the steps to stream DVD media files to Apple TV.

[Download for Mac](http://download.cnet.com/5KPlayer/3000-13632%5F4-76423535.html?part=dl-&subj=dl&tag=button) [Download for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) 

Before you go further, you need to install Apple TV DLNA app. The recommended Apple TV DLNA apps are Plex DLNA APP for Apple TV 4th gen, Local Cast, etc. Install one of them, run it and then do as follows:

**Step 1.** Download this DLNA-based DVD player and launch it. Connect your computer and Apple TV to the same network.

**Step 2.** Click on "DLNA&AirPlay" on the main UI and toggle on DLAN service on Mac

![Stream DVD video to Apple TV via DLNA](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/5kp-airplay-to-apple-tv.jpg) 

**Step 3.** Go back to the home screen and click the DLNA drop-down menu, then select Apple TV. Now you can stream your ripped DVD file from Mac/PC to DLAN certified Apple TV.

On top of 5KPlayer, other apps like Plex DLNA server for Mac, Serviio DLNA server for Mac, and Universal media server for Mac can also play the role of DLNA server to turn your MacBook/iMac into a media server for wireless media access. Give it a whirl if you have any of them installed on your Mac computer.

## Part 3\. FAQs about DVD Playing on Apple TV

### 1\. How to fix the Airplay grey screen when watching DVDs?

The DVD player goes grey screen when you mirror a DVD to Apple TV is caused by the copy protection. Due to the copyright, the DVD player is blocking the AirPlay screen mirroring and thus you will see a grey screen. In other words, you can only watch unprotected DVDs on Apple TV via Airplay (but don't use Mac's DVD player app), or you need to strip the copy protection from the DVD. 

### 2\. Can I connect an Apple DVD-player to Apple TV and play DVDs on it?

 No. Apple TV is a media streaming device for accessing content from online services as well as local files over the network. The DVD player can only be connected to your computer, not to the Apple TV Box. A DVD player connected to a computer will be blocked from airplay due to copy protection. You need a DVD player connected to your TV or need to convert the DVD to a DRM-free file for Apple TV. 

### 3\. Why can't I mirror movies to Apple TV?

If you fail to AirPlay the converted DVD movies from your Mac to Apple TV, you can check: the AirPlay settings on both Mac and Apple TV are set to On; both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network; make sure the device is compatible with AirPlay.

### 4\. Why did Apple get rid of the DVD player?

The major reason lies in that the DVD player is bulky and power-intensive.

### 5\. How do I stream DVDs to my TV?

Make a digital copy of DVD disc first. As for homemade unprotected DVDs, you can use Handbrake to rip DVDs to MP4 digital format and then stream ripped DVD movies to Plex media server. Then, you can directly watch DVD movies on TV via your Plex library. In terms of copyright protected DVDs, MacX DVD Ripper Pro is your best mate, ripping any protected DVDs to MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, etc. for your later playback on TV via Plex or USB flash drive. 

## Conclusion

 By following this comprehensive guide, you can unlock the full potential of your Apple TV and enjoy your favorite DVDs seamlessly. Remember, while Apple TV may not directly support DVD playback, with the right tools and techniques, you can overcome this limitation and elevate your home entertainment experience. So go ahead, grab your popcorn, and get ready to enjoy your DVD collection on the big screen with Apple TV.
