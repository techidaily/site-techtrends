## Spiderman: Into The Spider-verse

![Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse title](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WH3LrIgGthcYrF-LLrVo7vTty70=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/spiderverse-a69b157269914571ba82147b97782bbe.jpg)

**Genre:** Action, Adventure

**Starring:** Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfield

**Directors:** Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman

**Motion Picture Rating:** PG

**Running Time:** 1 hour 57 minutes

 Into the Spider-verse is a Spiderman movie unlike any other. It follows Miles Morales, who gains the powers of Spiderman after getting bit by a spider. The movie explores the different versions of Spiderman, with plenty of action and fun moments. The best part about the movie, though, lies in its unique animated world, full of vibrant colors and somewhere between 2D and 3D. Watching in surround sound only makes the experience that much better, as you take in all the bass-heavy action tracks as the multi-layered sound environments.

## Ready Player One

![Ready Player One title](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9Co_c660Nm_H5hIgJRur-jK56cc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/readyplayerone-599be4f56122459a9a95a668f27b6915.jpg)

**IMDb Rating:** 7.4/10

**Genre:** Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure

**Starring:** Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke

**Director:** Steven Spielberg

**Motion Picture Rating:** PG-13

**Running Time:** 2 hours 20 minutes

 The premise of this movie focuses on a fully-immersive video game, where players put on a headset and truly feel like they are in the game's world. So, it makes sense the creators of this movie would try to emulate this effect as much as possible for viewers. Dolby Atmos allows this feeling to be actualized, as you experience the noises of a fast-paced race or subtle sounds of the game's world.

## A Quiet Place

![A Quiet Place title](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uw467TNn3xKlJxStOYGCbi-ohOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/quietplace-4e1aa30f7dd84acfa0a7f131beb881e1.jpg)

**IMDb Rating:** 7.5/10

**Genre:** Horror, Drama, Sci-Fi

**Starring:** Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Millicent Simmonds

**Director:** John Krasinski

**Motion Picture Rating:** PG-13

**Running Time:** 1 hour 30 minutes

 You might think this movie wouldn't have much to offer surround-sound wise, since the focus is on a family who must stay quiet or risk being heard by alien-like creatures. However, it's this use of sound in the film that really propels it into an incredibly suspenseful experience. You may find yourself holding your breath once or twice during the close encounters with the movie's creatures, hearing every up-close and claustrophobic sound.

**IMDb Rating:** 6.8/10

**Genre:** Horror, Thriller

**Starring:** Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elizabeth Moss

**Director:** Jordan Peele

**Motion Picture Rating:** R

**Running Time:** 1 hour 56 minutes

 Director Jordan Peele, who was also the mind behind the movie Get Out, released his next thought-provoking film Us to great critical acclaim. It follows a family who decide to take a trip to their mother's childhood beach house, yet something deeply strange begins to take place. If you're a fan of horror, but want something a bit different, this is a great movie to pick up. Not least because of its impressive use of Dolby Atmos sound, which really starts to take hold when the doppelganger-versions of the family appear, adding an extra punch to the unfolding action.

**IMDb Rating:** 7.7/10

**Genre:** Drama

**Starring:** Yalizta Aparicio, Marina de Tavira, Diego Cortina Autrey

**Director:** Alfonso Cuaron

**Motion Picture Rating:** R

**Running Time:** 2 hours 15 minutes

 Alfonso Cuaron, who also directed Gravity, was a big fan of what Dolby Atmos could do. He believed the technology was actually better suited to more intimate environments, rather than in-your-face blockbusters. He provided some compelling evidence to this theory with Roma, a film where he gave his sound mixers many months to create their sound design. If you want to witness the subtle power Atmos can achieve, watch Roma.

**IMDb Rating:** 8.1/10

**Genre:** Action, Drama, Sci-Fi

**Starring:** Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen

**Director:** James Mangold

**Motion Picture Rating:** R

**Running Time:** 2 hours 17 minutes

 Logan is a superhero movie unlike most others, following the much older and wearier Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman. This film is mainly a character study, however it is still a Wolverine film, and therefore has plenty of action. The Dolby Atmos usage in this movie spreads sound across all speakers, placing you right in the middle of any scene. The rating seriously on this film.

## Deadpool

**IMDb Rating:** 8.0/10

**Genre:** Comedy, Action, Adventure

**Starring:** Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller

**Director:** Tim Miller

**Motion Picture Rating:** R

**Running Time:** 1 hour 48 minutes

 Speaking of unique superhero movies, Deadpool is a great movie to put on to see how far your speakers can go. It's extremely hilarious, but filled with gripping action sequences, and Dolby Atmos takes it to another level entirely. They compliment the movie's distinct visual style, and enhances the fourth-wall breaking elements. Sound effects, such as gun shots, crashes, and lots of explosions, are bolstered up with Atmos. This is a fun movie, but it's most definitely not for kids.

 FAQ

* How do I enable Dolby Atmos on a Samsung TV?  
 Press **Home** on your remote control and go to **Settings** \> **Sound** \> **Expert Settings** . Select **Digital Output Audio Format**  \> **Dolby Digital+** or **Auto**  to play Dolby Atmos content from streaming apps. If you hooked up a Dolby Atmos soundbar through an [HDMI eARC](https://www.lifewire.com/audio-return-channel-1846845) port, select and turn on **HDMI eARC Mode**  and **Dolby Atmos Compatibility** .
* How do I turn on Dolby Atmos on my Fire TV?  
 First, make sure you're [using a Fire Stick](https://www.lifewire.com/use-a-firestick-5205139) or Fire TV device with Dolby Atmos support and a compatible sound system. Go to **Settings** \> **Audio** \> **Surround Sound** \> **Best Available** . Play Dolby Atmos content and then choose **Options** \> **Audio** \> **Audio output** \> **Dolby Atmos** .
* Where should you place your surround speakers?  
 The ideal surround sound placement will depend on your room and whether you're using a 5.1, 7.1, or a 9.1 setup. However, there are a couple of evergreen rules to follow regardless of how many speakers you're using. You should try to have your speakers equidistant from each other with surround speakers placed in the corners around your listening area. You should also try to keep your speakers free of obstructions and away from alcoves, and if you can safely mount them on a wall, even better.
