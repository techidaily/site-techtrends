##  How Do I Watch Fandango at Home Movies on My Fire Stick for Free? 

 One of the features Fandango at Home shares with other services such as Freevee is by offering limited content choices for free. However, you can’t access these choices directly from your Fire Stick. You won’t see a “free” option on your onscreen menu.

 Therefore, you have to get creative and cast to your Fire Stick from your PC. Follow these steps to do so.
