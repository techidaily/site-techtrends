## Ultimate Guide to the Leading Apple Watches in 2T24: Detailed Analysis and Expert Ratings

It's no secret that Apple dominates the [smartwatch market](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/global-smartwatch-market-share/). However, since the Apple Watch is available in different variants, it can be a challenge to figure out which model is right for you, whether you are buying one for the first time or upgrading to a newer model. 

While the Apple Watch started as a [fitness tracker](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/) slightly more sophisticated than a [Fitbit](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitbit/), it has steadily expanded to become an expansive health monitoring device and a handy tool for fast access to information and apps. It can now check your heart rate, carry your boarding pass for a flight, identify a song that's playing nearby, open your garage door, alert you when it's about to rain, and guide you to breathe when you get stressed -- and those are just a few examples.

## What is the best Apple Watch right now?

Based on my years of testing, my pick for the best Apple Watch overall is the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2-gps-cellular-49mm-titanium-case-with-orange-beige-trail-loop-medium-large-titanium%2F6574421.p%3FskuId%3D6574421&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), thanks to its large screen, 24-hour battery life, and emergency siren.

### Best Apple Watch overall

The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers more exclusive features than any other Apple Watch model. The most notable and useful difference between the Ultra and the other Apple Watch models is the larger, brighter, flatter screen that's covered by a sapphire crystal face and surrounded by a titanium case to considerably increase the amount of wear and tear it can handle. It's also IPX6 dust resistant, works underwater up to 100 meters (328 feet), and has military-grade (MIL-STD 810H) certification for ruggedness. Plus, the Ultra 2 can handle high altitudes, shocks, vibrations, and temperatures as low as 4 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Review: [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-spent-a-week-with-the-apple-watch-ultra-2-and-heres-what-stood-out-the-most/)**

ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller also tried out the Apple Watch Ultra 2 when it was released last year, and said he enjoyed the watch "for its long battery life, brighter display, expanded connectivity, and new watch bands" while also being impressed by the improved mental health functionality via the Mindfulness app.

The Ultra 2 adds more exclusive features as well, including a programmable Action Button with a variety of workout and adventuring functions (it can also simply activate the flashlight), dual-frequency GPS that can overcome interference from mountains and skyscrapers, and dual integrated speakers that are much louder for taking phone calls, playing music, or interacting with Siri. 

Many Amazon reviewers who have bought this watch say that it's the best Apple Watch model they have ever used, calling out the watch's quality and large 49mm screen with 3,000 nits of brightness in particular. Beyond that, the Ultra offers one key addition to the Apple Watch Series 9 lineup: an emergency siren (activated by holding down the Action Button), which belts out an 86-decibel sound pattern that can be heard up to 600 feet (180 meters) away. This can help if you get lost or take a fall on a hike to ward off wild animals or to scare off attackers.

**Apple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs**: **Display Size:** 49mm | **Battery life:** Up to 72 hours | **Storage capacity:** 64GB | **Features:** Sturdy titanium case and sapphire crystal face, enhanced safety features including a built-in siren, dual-frequency GPS, works up to 100 meters underwater

## Apple Watch Series 9

### Best Apple Watch for most people

The Apple Watch Series 9 can track activity, steps, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen (lung function), wrist temperature, sleep, and environmental sound levels (to protect your hearing), all of which customers who have reviewed the watch say "make day to day living so much easier." And it uses algorithms and machine learning to spot dangerous patterns and alert you to seek medical attention if needed. There are now [many stories of people who've had life-saving experiences](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-watch-lifesaving-health-features-read-5-peoples-stories/) with health alerts from an Apple Watch. 

**Review:** [**Apple Watch Series 9**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-review/)

In my hands-on testing, there are two big upgrades in the Apple Watch Series 9\. The first is a 2,000 nit display that is double the brightness of last year's S8\. The second is the new S9 SiP processor, which has a 30% faster GPU and processes machine learning twice as fast. This makes everything quicker, makes the animations smoother, and enables features like the new double-tap gesture and faster and more accurate Siri commands.

**Also:** [**Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Apple Watch Series 8: Should you upgrade?**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-9-vs-apple-watch-series-8/)

If you want the latest health sensors and safety features, great battery life (especially if you want to do sleep tracking), and you don't need the extreme features in the Ultra 2, then you can save a lot of money by going with the aluminum model of the Apple Watch Series 9 starting at $399\. However, if you decide you want the tougher stainless steel finish (starting at $699), then I'd say skip that and go straight to the Ultra because for $100 more, you get a lot of extra features. The one exception to that might be if you have a smaller wrist.

**Apple Watch Series 9 tech specs: Display size:** 41mm or 45mm | **Battery life:** Up to 36 hours | **Storage capacity:** 64GB | **Features:** New features include a 2x brighter display, double-tap gesture, new pink color, robust S9 processor, and all the best health sensors Apple has to offer

Pros 
* Family Setup for kids and older adults
* Health and location tracking
* Fall and crash detection
* Very affordable

Cons 
* Not as durable as other Apple Watch models
* Cellular connection requires a monthly fee

### Best Apple Watch for kids and first-time buyers

Starting at $249, what I found amazing about the Apple Watch SE (2nd gen) is how many of the same health and safety features from the Series 8 and the Ultra it actually includes. It's easier to talk about what's not included in the SE -- it doesn't track blood oxygen, do ECG heart checks, or check your temperature. And while the face looks just like the Series 8, the screen is actually about 20% smaller, and it also doesn't have an always-on display.

Still, it includes nearly everything else, and the cellular connectivity is only a $50 add-on for the SE (compared to a $100 add-on for the Series 8). Like the Ultra and the Series 8, adding a cellular connection will also cost you about $10/month with your wireless carrier. Even if you go with the cellular version and opt for the larger 44mm Apple Watch SE over the smaller 40mm version, you'll still only top out at $329.

**Also: [Apple Watch SE (2022) vs Apple Watch SE (2020): Should you upgrade?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-se-2022-vs-apple-watch-se-2020-should-you-upgrade/)**

That makes it a great smartwatch to give to someone who doesn't have an iPhone, such as a child or an elderly family member, using [Apple's Family Setup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768). With cellular connectivity, they can use the Apple Watch to make and receive phone calls, get text messages, dictate replies to texts, and connect to online info like the weather. 

You can even set it up from your iPhone as long as they are in your Apple family group. If you are connecting an elderly relative who has health issues, the added health sensors in the Series 8 might make it worth the peace of mind to upgrade. Customers who have reviewed the watch also agree that it offers excellent value for the price, especially if you are new to the Apple Watch family.

**Apple Watch SE tech specs: Display size:** 40mm or 44mm | **Battery life**: Up to 18 hours | **Storage capacity:** 32GB | **Features:** Most affordable Apple Watch, family setup for kids and older adults, health and location tracking, and fall and crash detection

Pros 
* Comes in unique blue and green colors
* Good deal if you buy used or refurbished
* Has most of the latest health features
* Water, dust, and crack resistant

Cons 
* Shorter battery life than the Series 8 or Series 9
* Display isn't as bright as the Series 9

## Apple Watch Series 7

### Best Apple Watch for unique colors

When it first launched in fall 2021, the Apple Watch Series 7 brought key upgrades including a 20% larger screen, fast charging (0% to 80% in 45 minutes with a USB-C cable), a more durable face that's made out of crystal and is 50% thicker than the previous model, and IPX6 dust resistance. Those are features that still aren't available on the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen. 

**Review:** **[Apple Watch Series 7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-7-review/)**

With the SE now holding down the entry-level Apple Watch market, it's best to think about buying the Series 7 in comparison to the SE. If you just want a low-cost entry into the Apple Watch ecosystem and an easy purchase, then you can buy a new SE and quickly get started. A new Apple Watch Series 7 costs nearly the same price as the Series 8, so it's much better to get the Series 8\. However, you can find a refurbished Series 7 for $200-$250 on places like [BackMarket](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd#model=999%20Apple%20Watch%20Series%207) and [RefurbMe](https://www.refurb.me/refurbished/apple-watch/series-7). Amazon also sells refurbished models, and the overall reviews from customers who bought a previously owned Apple Watch Series 7 were positive, with no complaints about battery life or the condition of the watch.

There are really only a few great reasons to buy the Series 7 at this point. The first is if you want the additional health features (heart and lung tracking) for an Apple Watch you're giving to an elderly relative or if you want the extra durability for an Apple Watch you're giving to a kid. The other big reason to buy the Series 7 is that it comes in two really nice colors -- green and blue -- that Apple no longer offers for the Series 8\. But again, if you're going to get a Series 7, I'd recommend getting a refurbished one.

**Apple Watch Series 7 tech specs: Display size:** 41mm or 45mm | **Battery life:** Up to 18 hours | **Storage**: 32GB | **Features:** Large display, fast charging, health-focused features, and more durable than the SE

Pros 
* High-quality, stylish bands
* Exclusive Hermès watch faces
* Includes an extra Sports Band in the box

Cons 
* Expensive for what you get
* Same features as regular Series 9

## Apple Watch Hermès

### Best Apple Watch for dressing up

If you're looking to splurge on a designer smartwatch, the Apple Watch Hermès is a chic option for fashionistas. The watch itself is an Apple Watch Series 9, but you'll get exclusive Hermès watch faces and different case etchings. 

What you're really paying for, however, are the Hermès bands, like [Rouge H Bridon Double Tour](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHN3AM/A/apple-watch-herm%C3%A8s-41mm-rouge-h-bridon-double-tour?fnode=1c52ac7fce4305d4430bfd8c8777233cef507e396b72edf93b5bfc027cfdf2e599b1cc05ade92afa6d53c25e2518541683d02e1d189fadd6fda14a2daab1f299f546ecfe9e27e9722f7e6630dda82c1a) that wraps around your wrist twice. There are plenty of stylish bands to choose from, like the [Noir/Gold Twill Jump Single Tour](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHE3AM/A/apple-watch-herm%C3%A8s-41mm-noir-gold-twill-jump-single-tour?fnode=1c52ac7fce4305d4430bfd8c8777233cef507e396b72edf93b5bfc027cfdf2e599b1cc05ade92afa6d53c25e2518541683d02e1d189fadd6fda14a2daab1f299f546ecfe9e27e9722f7e6630dda82c1a) band or the [Kilim Single Tour](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTHV3AM/A/apple-watch-herm%C3%A8s-41mm-orange-kilim-single-tour?fnode=1c52ac7fce4305d4430bfd8c8777233cef507e396b72edf93b5bfc027cfdf2e599b1cc05ade92afa6d53c25e2518541683d02e1d189fadd6fda14a2daab1f299f546ecfe9e27e9722f7e6630dda82c1a) in signature orange.

The versions of this watch that Apple sells no longer include options for the classic Hermès leather bands, now that Apple has eliminated leather from the product. However, Hermès sells leather bands for its edition of the Apple Watch on its site.

As you might expect, the price range for this Apple Watch model will cost you a lot more for the designer brand name. This model ranges from $1,249 to $1,349\. All models include cellular (activation and monthly plan not included) and Apple's higher-end stainless steel casings that are also offered on the Apple Watch Series 9\. 

**Apple Watch Hermès** **tech specs:** **Display size:** 41mm or 45mm | **Battery** **life:** Up to 36 hours | **Storage**: 64GB | **Features:** Stylish and quality bands, exclusive Hermès watch faces, and case etchings on display

| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apple Watch Ultra 2            | All the best smartwatch features Apple has to offer. While the Ultra 2 is especially loaded with fitness and durability features for athletes and adventurers, its larger and brighter display, better battery life, and emergency siren will appeal to many others as well.      |
| Apple Watch Series 9           | All the latest health and fitness features at an approachable price. It tracks heart health, breathing, temperature, sleep, and, of course, activity and fitness. The Apple Watch keeps getting smarter, and this is the best-selling model.                                      |
| Apple Watch SE                 | A more budget-friendly Apple Watch. This includes all the basic features at a lower price and is a great pick for first-time Apple Watch buyers or to give to a kid or an elderly family member, since you can configure it using Family Setup even if they don't have an iPhone. |
| Apple Watch Series 7           | An Apple Watch in unique blue or green colors. The Apple Watch Series 7 is for sale in many places, and you can get a refurbished model for $200 to $275\. The best reason to get it is the fact that it comes in two unique colors you can't get in the Series 9.                |
| Apple Watch Hermès             | An Apple Watch for dressing up as well as working out. For those who love the French luxury brand, this special edition of the Apple Watch features premium bands and exclusive watch faces for those who view their timepiece as a fashion accessory.                            |

## Factors to consider when choosing the best Apple Watch

While all the Apple Watches on this list have a slew of health-tracking features and other useful apps, their differences are what you need to consider before buying one, including: 

* **Display size:** Apple Watch displays now come in essentially three different sizes (40/41, 44/45, and 49). Depending on the size of your wrist and how much you want to interact with the watch for quick actions, the display size will be a big factor in determining which model makes the most sense.
* **Features:** Apple methodically adds more and more new features to the Apple Watch each year, so we compared safety features, health sensors, band options, battery life, and other useful options.
* **Pricing:** Each Apple Watch has a number of different variations, so pricing can vary widely -- especially based on which band you pick. We included budget-worthy options below $250, as well as the more premium options that are over $1,000.

## How we test smartwatches

All of the Apple Watches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when [tested in the real world](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/) by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.

* **Daily wear**: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch, with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it were our only smartwatch.
* **Application selection and performance**: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. For example, Apple particularly excels in the area of third-party application support.
* **Workouts**: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take smartwatches out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.
* **Sleep and activity tracking:** Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate and compare them to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.

For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive [smartwatch testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-smartwatches-at-zdnet-in-2024/).

## What is new in the Apple Watch 10?

Apple just announced the new Apple Watch Series 10 during its September event, and there are several notable features. First, the screen sizes are bigger (42 mm and 46 mm), and Apple said this is the thinnest Apple Watch to date, meaning it should be more comfortable on your wrist. 

The Series 10 also has a new [sleep apnea-tracking feature](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-watch-series-10-gains-sleep-apnea-detection-and-it-could-save-your-life/), which monitors movements associated with respiratory pattern interruptions and is tracked by Apple's new Breathing Disturbances metric. 

There is also a new depth gauge, which measures up to six meters beneath the water's surface, and a water temperature sensor, which is great if you're into water sports. 

Finally, the Apple Watch 10 has a new jet black finish, along with "updated" rose gold and brushed silver aluminum finishes. 

The Apple Watch 10 costs $399 and is available Friday, September 20\. You can [preorder here](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch). 

## Do you need an iPhone to use an Apple Watch?

Yes, you need an iPhone to set up an Apple Watch. However, with all the models on this list, you can use the [Family Setup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768) option to have one iPhone set up watches for multiple members in your Apple family group -- even if they don't have an iPhone. You cannot use an iPad, a Mac, or a non-Apple smartphone to set up an Apple Watch.

## What does the Apple Watch do?

Fundamentally, all Apple Watches can track your steps and fitness data, display notifications from your iPhone, show basic information like weather, start timers, send and receive text messages, answer phone calls, and download useful apps. The latest versions have additional features and functionality, including sleep tracking, advanced health monitoring, car crash detection, and international emergency calling.

## Are older versions of the Apple Watch still worth buying?

Yes, many older Apple Watch are available to buy refurbished at places like [BackMarket](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/l/apple-watch/38fd0158-d500-43d2-817c-738859e3e7dd) and are still some of the best smartwatches on the market. Just keep in mind that Apple releases a new Apple Watch each year, so a refurbished model that is already dated could end up being four or five generations behind the latest innovations during the time you own it.

## What are some features to look for in the best Apple Watch models?

The most important features to look for in the best Apple Watch models include advanced health sensors (ECG, blood oxygen, wrist temperature, etc.), connectivity options (is cellular included or extra, if you want the watch to work when an iPhone isn't nearby), battery life, and durability (water resistance, dust resistance, and a crystal face to resist cracking).

## Which is the best Apple Watch for fitness tracking?

The best Apple Watch for fitness tracking is the Apple Watch Series 9 or the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which both come equipped with the widest variety of health sensors, including ECG, sleep tracking, heart and breathing functions, wrist temperature, and more.

## What is the difference between the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 8, and Series 7?

The Apple Watch Series 9 brings a 2,000-nit display (twice as bright as the Series 8), a new hands-free double-tap gesture, and the new S9 SiP, which makes the watch run faster and smoother. The Apple Watch Series 8 introduced a more scratch-resistant crystal face, a temperature sensor, next-gen motion tracking, crash detection, and emergency SOS (all of which are also included in the Series 9). These are all features that the Series 7 doesn't include, but it features two unique colors -- blue and green -- no longer available on either the Series 9 or the Series 8.

## Is the Apple Watch Ultra 2 worth the extra cost for outdoor enthusiasts?

If you're someone who spends time hiking, doing triathlons, and involved in outdoor activities in extreme temperatures, rugged conditions, and lots of dust and water, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 may be worth the extra cost. Its design makes it more durable and water-resistant (up to 100m) than the other Apple Watch models, and it includes an Action Button for fine-tuning workouts and hikes.

## What Apple Watch is best for kids?

While it's not made specifically with kids in mind, the Apple Watch SE is an excellent smartwatch for older kids with standout features plus parental controls. Along with enabling phone calls and text messages, the Apple Watch SE also tracks your child's sleep, has state-of-the-art health trackers, features an SOS capability, and pairs with thousands of apps.

In addition, you can use Apple's Family Setup to check your kid's location, set up shared contacts, implement parental controls like screen time usage, and more. Your child doesn't even need their own iPhone to have an Apple Watch -- they can [pair it up with yours](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-pair-and-unpair-apple-watch/), so you're fully in control. 

## Does Apple Watch work with Android?

You cannot use an Android phone to set up and pair with an Apple Watch, and there are no good workarounds for that. However, if you have an Android phone, there are several smartwatches you can choose from that offer most of the same features as an Apple Watch. The ones below are smartwatches that ZDNET has reviewed and rated well in our testing.

## When do Apple Watches go on sale?

Apple is one of those brands that rarely puts its products on sale, so the best time to snag a deal on an Apple Watch is during big sales events like Black Friday weekend or Amazon Prime Day. 

However, sometimes random deals pop up, so be sure to check out our [best Apple deals](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deals/) roundup that we update frequently.
