## Review Gemini's Answer With More Features

 You don't have to accept Gemini's original answer. The generative AI chatbot offers a few extra methods to change the style of the answer.  

1. Select**Show drafts** and view two more versions of the result. You can choose**Regenerate drafts** to force Gemini to make another attempt at better answers.  
![The "Hide/Show drafts" and "Regenerate drafts" options in Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qA7gawJp3_oXG1w3DcDUr9ydFBE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Hide-drafts-and-regenerate-google-gemini-9cbbe551f2904f008b8c05bcf385caa5.jpg)
2. Give Gemini's large language model some feedback by choosing the**Good response** or**Bad response** icons (the thumb icons).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. The**Modify response** filter pop-up helps you adjust the length, simplify the language, and change the tone of a response. Use this to tailor the answers for your intended audience or finetune them.

4. Instead of making Gemini rewrite the entire content, you can modify parts of the generated responses. Highlight any part of the text and select the**Modify selected text** icon.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

 Enter a fresh prompt in the Modify with a prompt field to describe how you want the selected text to change, and then press**Enter** . The other options of**Regenerate** ,**Shorter** ,**Longer** , and**Remove** are self-explanatory.
