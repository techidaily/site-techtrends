 Bose has been one of the biggest and most trusted names in home audio for years, and their Smart Soundbar 300 is one of the best you can buy. It features four speaker drivers for room-filling audio. With Simple Sync or the Bose Music App, you can connect it to other Bose home audio products to play your favorite music or audio from shows and movies throughout your house. The app also lets you set up multiple user profiles, so if you have movie buffs, audiophiles, and TV fanatics under the same roof, everyone can create an audio setup that is right for them.

 The Smart Soundbar 300 works with Alexa and Google Assistant for hands-free voice controls and better integration into your smart home theater or home network. It is also compatible with[Apple AirPlay](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-airplay-mirroring-explained-2000228) and[Spotify Connect](https://www.lifewire.com/spotify-connect-4570995) to wirelessly stream music from your smartphone or tablet with or without an internet connection.

 Along with a hardwired HDMI connection, you can use Bluetooth for a wireless audio setup; coupled with the soundbar's low profile, it's perfect for home theaters and living rooms that may be on the smaller side. The soundbar has a super-fast, plug-and-play setup, meaning you can connect it to your TV, plug it into the wall, and enjoy enhanced audio immediately. It also features a bass boost option for those deep, rich low tones that help make action or horror movies feel more intense.

 Pros

* Easily fits on a shelf or mantle
* 700W output
* Bluetooth

 Cons

* No voice controls
* Limited equalizer controls
* Can't connect satellite speakers

 If your living room is on the smaller side, or you want to avoid huge, clunky speakers clogging up your space, the LG XBOOM is an excellent option. This sound system has two speakers and a subwoofer measuring 12.4 x 8.1 x 11.2 inches, making them small enough to fit on a shelf, mantle, or dedicated table to free up floor space.

 With[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) and Sound Sync, you can wirelessly connect the system to your TV or mobile devices to reduce clutter for a clean-looking home theater. This system isn't just speakers; you can play CDs, listen to your favorite radio stations, or plug in a USB device to stream custom playlists. The auto DJ mode automatically removes the silence between songs for continuous music, making it great for parties or casual listening.

 There are five preset equalizers for pop, rock, and classical genres, so your songs will sound their best whether you're listening to '60s beach rock or Beethoven. And just because this system is smaller, that doesn't mean LG skimped on power. This system has an impressive 700W output, meaning music and movies can be heard over party guests talking and ambient noise. However, if you have neighbors nearby who don't appreciate your music, you may end up with civil noise complaints.

 Pros

* Bluetooth
* Automatic calibration
* Four HDMI inputs

 Cons

* Not wireless
* No voice controls

 The Yamaha YHT-4950U home theater system is perfectly designed for living rooms and home theaters on the larger side. This system has a receiver, five speakers, and a subwoofer, so you can set up a custom configuration without purchasing additional speakers.

 It also has a microphone that listens to ambient noise, automatically calibrating the system to deliver the perfect surround sound experience. While the speakers and[subwoofers](https://www.lifewire.com/subwoofers-information-1845744) are wired to the receiver, you can use Bluetooth to connect the system to your TV or mobile devices wirelessly, or you can use one of the HDMI ports for a hardwired connection or 4K passthrough.

 With up to 400W of output power, you'll get rich audio that fills the room or whole house, and Dolby audio support creates clean, clear sound for dialogue and high tones.

## What to Look For in a Home Theater Starter Kit

### Wireless vs. Wired

 Many new home theater starter kits feature Bluetooth connectivity. This lets you wirelessly connect the receiver, speakers, or soundbar to your TV or set up satellite speakers, making them perfect for smaller or oddly shaped rooms. Wired systems offer more stable connections between the receiver and speakers or the receiver and your TV but aren't ideal for smaller spaces where wires could cause clutter or trip hazards.

### Bluetooth Connectivity

 Bluetooth connectivity allows a wireless connection to your TV and lets you stream music from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop without a hardwired connection. Some systems and soundbars also have a tap-to-stream feature where you touch your device to the soundbar or receiver to share music instantly.

### Speaker Size

 Bigger is sometimes better when it comes to speakers. Large speakers are great for larger rooms or use as statement pieces in your decor, but they sometimes have less powerful audio output. Small speakers are great for tucking away on a shelf or mantle for a more understated look but can sound tinny and weak. You'll want to pair the speaker size you need for your space with a receiver or soundbar with decent output wattage: Something in the 150-200W range is perfect for most rooms.

 FAQ

* Should you buy a home theater system or a soundbar?  
 That depends on what you want the system to do. Most soundbars nowadays eliminate the need for multiple satellite speakers by combining several drivers into a single unit. They're great for enhancing TV and film audio and music but could be better at creating authentic surround sound. Traditional systems with a receiver and speakers allow you to customize your setup and avoid annoying echoes that can come with tall ceilings or narrow rooms, but they also require much more space to set up.
* Do you need a subwoofer with a soundbar?  
 Not necessarily! Some models have subwoofers built-in or use bass reflex ports to simulate subwoofer functions. More high-end models come packaged with dedicated subwoofers that provide an enhanced bass boost or use downward-firing drivers for bass you can feel and hear. You'll have to decide if you want a cinema-like experience with deep, bone-rumbling bass or richer low tones while listening to your favorite Spotify playlists.
* How do you choose a good soundbar?  
 There are many different factors to consider when shopping for a new soundbar, chief of which is the size of your space. You'll want a soundbar that fits under your TV or can be easily wall-mounted. You also want to see how many speaker drivers it has to get the best audio in your living room; the more drivers, the more nuanced the sound. Also, consider connectivity since wires can cause trip hazards and be an eyesore in smaller home theaters and living rooms.
