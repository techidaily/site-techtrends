## Ways to Customize Folder Colors on Mac

 Folders in[macOS](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-macos-4691239) are all a pleasant shade of blue, which can lead to a sea of sameness on your desktop that eventually becomes difficult to navigate. If you have a few important ones you want to keep track of, you can change folder color on Mac without too much trouble.

 Apple gives you a few different ways to change folder colors in macOS, and you can also use custom non-folder icons in place of the traditional folder icon. Here are the main ways to customize your folder icons:

* **Use the built-in Preview app** : This method uses the Preview app to tweak the color of a folder icon.
* **Copy a different image using the Preview app** : This method copies a photo or icon using the Preview app, so it can change the color of a folder icon, replace it with an image, or even replace it with a custom icon.
* **Use a premium app like Folder Color** : This method requires a premium app like Folder Color, which you can buy from the App Store. It automates the process and makes it easier.

14. You can now close the Folder Info box, and your folder will have the new color. If you want, you can repeat this process to customize as many folders as you like.

## Customizing Folders With Images and Icons

 You can[customize your folders with your own images and custom icons](https://www.lifewire.com/personalize-mac-by-changing-desktop-icons-2260911) using this same basic process.

 Instead of pasting a copy of your original folder into Preview, you need to open a photo or icon with Preview, and copy it. You can then paste it into the Folder Info box just like you did in step 11 above.

 These steps will replace the original folder icon with a custom photo or any other icon you like.

## Changing Folder Colors on Mac With Apps

 If the process outlined above seems too complicated or time consuming, you will find apps like[Folder Color](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/folder-color-design-custom-folder-icons/id918402174?mt=12) in the app store that are designed to automate the process.

 Folder Color in particular allows you to change the color of a folder, add small icons and decorations to a folder, replace a folder with an image, or even quickly edit one of your images into the shape of a folder.
