## More on Hashtags 

 If you're using multiple hashtags in your Instagram caption, try separating them from the actual caption, so it doesn't look cluttered and hard to read. Type out your caption and then make multiple line breaks, placing the hashtags at the end. Some users put periods at the start of their line breaks to help guide the viewer's eyes down toward the hashtags.
