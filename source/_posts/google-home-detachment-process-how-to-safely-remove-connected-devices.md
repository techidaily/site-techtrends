##  Why Can’t I Remove a Device From My Google Account? 

 If you continue to see your device after you’ve removed it, try these tactics.

### Reset the Device 

 A good measure to take even if you’re planning to keep your device is to factory reset it. To factory reset your Google Home device, refer to the product documentation for specifics. We also have some guides here on Lifewire,[ such as this one to reset a Google Home speaker](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-google-home-mini-max-4172324) .

 On some devices, such as the Nest Thermostat, you’ll find this option from the**Settings** menu. Others have you hold down a physical button to initiate the factory reset.

 If you set up your Nest device with the Nest app, the chances are that’s the best place to remove it from your Google account.

###  Unlink it From Assistant Settings 

 The device could still be linked to your account. Check and remove it from Assistant settings.

1. Tap the**Settings** tab and then choose**Google Assistant** from the list of options.
2. Select**Manage all Assistant settings** \>**Devices** .

###  Delete the Associated Room or Home

 To remove a room in Google Home, go to**Settings** \>**Devices, groups & rooms** \> select the room >**Delete room** \>**Remove** .
