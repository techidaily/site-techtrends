## Mastering File Management: Launching Terminal in Windows Directories
### What to Know

* From the folder you want to open in Command Prompt, hold the**Shift** key, then**right-click** an empty area.
* From there, select**Open in Terminal** (W11) or**Open PowerShell window here** .
* Alternatively, change the folder path (at the top of File Explorer) to**cmd** . Press**Enter** to open CMD in that folder.

 This article teaches you how to open Command Prompt in a way that lets you start working from a specific folder immediately. Here's how to start CMD from a folder in Windows 11 (it's very similar in older versions).

## How to Open CMD in a Folder

 It's easy to[start Command Prompt the normal way](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) , but if you know which folder you want to run commands in, you'll save yourself a step or two if you open Command Prompt in the folder from the start. Below are two methods.

### Change the Folder Path

 Follow these steps for the fastest way to open Command Prompt in a folder. All you have to do is type**cmd** in the right place.

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/open-file-explorer-in-windows-11-5192605) to the folder you plan to work in. For example, if it's your Downloads folder, you'd navigate here:  
 `C:\Users\[yourÂ username]\Downloads`
2. Erase the folder path at the top of the window. Pressing**Alt** +**d** is a quick way to highlight the whole path.

3. Replace the path with**cmd** .

4. Press**Enter** . This will open Command Prompt directly to that folder.
