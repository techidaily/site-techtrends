##  How to Connect Your Nintendo Switch to Your TV

 Once you have all the materials above, connecting your Switch to your television takes only a minute.

1. Place your Nintendo Switch dock on a stable surface close to the television. Open the back cover of the dock.
2. Connect the AC adapter to the **AC Adapter** port, if it’s not already, and plug it into a wall outlet.
3. Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the **HDMI Out** port on the back of the dock and the other end into the HDMI port on the back of your TV.

4. Close the back cover of the dock while routing the cables through the opening.
5. Detach the Joy-Con controllers from the Switch. Press the button on the back of a Joy-Con and slide it upward to remove it. Do the same with the second Joy-Con.

 You can use the controllers as-is, connect the wrist straps, or slide them into the Joy-Con grip. If you purchased a Joy-Con Charging Grip, you could use that as well.
6. Put your Nintendo Switch into the dock. Make sure the screen faces the front of the dock where you see the Nintendo Switch logo.
7. Power on the Switch and your television. Adjust the input on your TV for the corresponding HDMI port you used.

 The screen on the Switch turns off when it’s in the dock, but you should now see the Switch's screen on your television. So, you should be ready to play!
