##  What's Included With the Nintendo Switch? 

 The original Nintendo Switch is more expensive than the Switch Light and less expensive than the Switch (OLED model). Here's an overview of what's in the box.

* **Nintendo Switch console** . The most important part! The Nintendo Switch console is a larger device than the Nintendo Switch Lite and has a detachable screen. It's slightly smaller than the Nintendo Switch (OLED model).
* **Two Nintendo Joy-Con Controllers.** Unlike the Nintendo Switch Lite, it's possible to detach the two Joy-Con controllers from the Nintendo Switch console, allowing you to use the controllers away from the console itself. It makes multiplayer gaming easier, with some games allowing players to use one Joy-Con each.
* **Nintendo Switch dock.** The primary distinction between the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch Lite is that it's possible to dock the Nintendo Switch, thereby allowing you to hook it up to your TV. The console comes with the dock to do this, and it also doubles up as a charging station.
* **Cables.** The Nintendo Switch comes with an HDMI cable to connect it to a TV and an AC to USB-C charging cable for power, and two wrist straps to attach to the Joy-Con controllers for safety.

##  What's Included With the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model)? 

 The Nintendo Switch (OLED model) is the most expensive of the Switch devices. It comes with everything a regular Switch comes with, but with more features and enhancements.

 It boasts a 7-inch OLED screen, 64GB of internal storage, a dock with a wired LAN port, and enhanced audio for handheld and tabletop play. The Switch (OLED model) also comes with a wide adjustable stand for tabletop mode.

##  What's Included With the Nintendo Switch Lite? 

 The[ Nintendo Switch Lite](https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-vs-nintendo-switch-lite-4770644) is much cheaper than the original Nintendo Switch or the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) but also includes far fewer accessories. It also has some limitations, such as the inability to dock with your TV and unremovable Joy-Cons. 

 Does Nintendo Switch Lite come with games? Officially it doesn't but, many retailers bundle games with the Nintendo Switch Lite to make it a more attractive "play straight out of the box" experience. 

 It's a far smaller list than the original Nintendo Switch console. Here's a look at what's in the box.

* **The Nintendo Switch Lite console** . The Nintendo Switch Lite console is smaller and lighter than the regular Nintendo Switch or the Switch (OLED model), as it's aimed at a more mobile market. Think of it as more like a Nintendo 3DS or similar to a home games console.
* **A charging cable** . The Nintendo Switch Lite console also comes with a charging cable and a wall plug.

##  What Should I Buy Alongside My Nintendo Switch Device? 

 Now that you know what already comes with your Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and Nintendo Switch (OLED model), it's a good idea to consider which Nintendo Switch accessories you may need to buy to go with it. Here are a few suggestions. 

* **Nintendo Switch Games** . A game console isn't much fun without a game to play. You can either buy physical game cartridges or buy Nintendo Switch credit to purchase games digitally via the[ Nintendo Game Store](https://www.nintendo.com/games/buy-digital/) .
* **MicroSD storage card** . Both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite have 32GB of internal storage. That's enough to store a few games, but if you intend on downloading a lot of them, you'll soon run out of space. A microSD storage card solves that issue allowing you to store many more games and save files. The Switch (OLED model) comes with 64GB of internal storage, so you'll have more room to store games.
* **Additional Joy-Con controllers** . If you plan on playing a lot of multiplayer games, extra Joy-Con controllers are a good buy. While the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons' detachable nature helps with some multiplayer games, a complete set is a useful extra. That's even more so the case with the Nintendo Switch Lite, as you can't detach the controllers.
* **A carry case** . Both consoles are portable, which means it's easy to scratch the sides or even the screen when taking it with you. A carry case makes it safer to move them around, plus you can store game cartridges and other items inside it.
