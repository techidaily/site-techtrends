## Discover the Mighty Performance of Anker's Soundcore Boom 2 – Stellar Sound Quality and Impressive Bass in a Compact Design

### Key Takeaways

* Soundcore Boom 2 features BassUp 2.0 for a major bass boost that takes music up a notch.
* The design is portable, party-friendly, and IPX7 waterproof.
* Some favorite features are customizable sound profiles, app support, and long battery life.

 Anker's Soundcore audio device lineup has grown into a trusted name that's topped some of the "best of" lists. The newest addition to its "Boom" lineup of portable boombox-style speakers is the [Soundcore Boom 2](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.soundcore.com%2Fpages%2Fboom2-bluetooth-speaker-for-bass), which boasts a 2.1 channel subwoofer and dual tweeters that deliver loud stereo sound with crystal-clear clarity.

 From on-ear headphones like the [Soundcore Space Q45 headphones](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-exceptional-counsel-premium-ringtone-developers/) to true wireless earbuds like the [Space A40](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/ideal-echo-reapers-in-colleges/), Soundcore by Anker has repeatedly impressed How-To Geek reviewers with the sound quality achieved at competitive price points. The Soundcore Boom 2 falls in line here too. While it isn't perfect, it offers a deeply satisfying audio experience for under $150, making its party vibes undeniable.

##  A Retro-Style Boombox With A Modern Edge and Stereo Sound

![Angled view of the Soundcore Boom 2.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/angled-view-of-the-soundcore-boom-2-2jpg_53500380681_o.jpg)

 At first glance, you might second-guess this is a Bluetooth speaker since its body style is lovingly chunky, like the famous scene from "Say Anything." But another look at its more modern construction reminds you that this is simply a Bluetooth homage to the evolution of audio.

 The highlight of this design, in my opinion, are the two built-in light areas with eight individual strips on either side that not only provide a fun party atmosphere with lights that sync to the music but also give visible vibrations as the three drivers pump out sound. While the Boom 2 doesn't have spatial audio like the [Motion X600](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-spoken-word-unveiled-enhancing-expressiveness-on-slides/), its three drivers are enough to produce a full stereo sound.

 The top of the Boom 2's body houses all the buttons, including volume, power, and a BassUp button. I personally loved having multiple actions built into the play and pause button. Navigating felt similar to wireless earbuds. My favorite button was the BassUp, which gave me a quick option to boost the bass whenever I wanted to, without using the app.

 The back of the speaker is where you'll find the two ports underneath a protective silicone cover. You can use the USB-A port to charge your phone (which worked fine for me in a pinch) or the USB-C to charge the speaker.

##  Take It Anywhere—Even in the Water

 At under four pounds, the Soundcore Boom 2 is a highly portable option that's fairly easy to carry. That said, the handle does feel a bit clunky and thick, so hefting it can feel awkward. Its body is just over four inches thick, so I also wedged it under my arm while transporting it. Overall, I forgave the awkward thickness of the handle. I took it with me to several places, including the park and a friend's house, and every time I was thrilled that I did.

 One outstanding feature is the IPX7 waterproof rating with float capability. Not only did I enjoy listening to music in the shower without worrying about water droplets damaging the speaker (which rested on the edge of the tub), but I also was able to float it in a pool. Water droplets left visible marks on the speaker's matte plastic body—which is a nit-picky pet peeve and easily remedied if you wipe off the Boom 2 after it's exposed to water. People who hate fingerprint marks will love that the Boom 2's lovely matte texture hid any fingerprints from sight, even after I touched the buttons, handle, and body endlessly.

##  The Sound Quality, the Soundcore App, and the Stand-Out Bass Booster

 No matter what song I played, the Soundcore Boom 2 sounded fantastic. And if I wanted to mess around with the EQ, it was simple to do so in the Soundcore App, available on [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soundcore/id1331876603) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002180/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanwing.soundcore). In my time jamming out, I enjoyed everything from classical to blues to post-hardcore. I often switched between Soundcore's basic "Preset" EQ settings and a couple of "Custom" EQ settings I made.

 At the time of my review, the Soundcore app didn't support the Boom 2, so I was using a beta version of the app. This meant limited availability for particular features, such as switching the lighting modes (which was frankly disastrous in beta, only offering two lighting modes in white light). Still, I enjoyed using the "Balanced," "Soundcore Signature," and "Voice" presets to highlight the strengths of different music genres, and I found the ability to customize my EQ by making "Custom" profiles invaluable—nine times out of 10, I preferred my own "Music Boost" EQ I made over the presets.

 My favorite thing about the Soundcore Boom 2 was its BassUp 2.0 technology. At the push of a button, I enjoyed a significantly louder, more bass-heavy boost in music that needed it. That means heavy rock, blues, or other genres with fantastic bass lines were taken from a three out of five-star listening experience to a nearly five out of five. Music lovers will love hitting this to kick up the subwoofer a notch.

 I confess I had it toggled on far more often than not while listening—even if it was simple piano music. And what of the treble and mid-ranges? They were also stars of the show and didn't feel too lost when I boosted the bass. At around 80 to 85% volume or louder, however, there is a significant drop in sound quality as the mid-range and treble muddies, but you can certainly get away with listening at that level if you want to.

 Since I was curious about the maximum decibel output of the Soundcore Boom 2, I used a few dB measurement tools to gauge the maximum output. I typically had its volume at 30 to 50% and felt satisfied in a small office space, but turning it up louder made my living room pop with music.

 Using the [Sound Meter and Noise Detector app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002180/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coocent.app.tools.soundmeter.noisedetector), the [Sound Meter app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002180/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splendapps.decibel), and a [free online sound meter](https://webbrowsertools.com/sound-meter/) in my web browser, I noticed a max dB of 104, 92, and 80, respectively, testing three different rock songs. While I assume these measurement tools aren't as accurate as using a professional dB meter, it gives an idea of how loud you can expect the Boom 2 to reach at full volume. A measurement of 80dB is considered to be quite loud—and [85dB is when you get into hearing loss territory](https://techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-for-motorola-moto-g24-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/). For more reference, the [average rock concert](https://www.reference.com/science/many-decibels-rock-concert-1b1e7439ec0d2158) is about 120dB.

##  Notes On Battery Life

 Soundcore quotes the battery life on the Boom 2 as up to 20 hours in the Boom 2 quick start guide. I found this to be wholly accurate and was pleased to find that a full charge got me through about three full work shifts before I needed to recharge it. If you don't listen as often, the Boom 2's battery should last about a week. Charging time takes about five hours, so it's best to charge it overnight when possible.

##  Should You Buy The Soundcore Boom 2?

 If you're looking for a mid-sized portable Bluetooth speaker that's compact but still makes music sound great, the [Soundcore Boom 2](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.soundcore.com%2Fpages%2Fboom2-bluetooth-speaker-for-bass) has everything you need in a party-style stereo-sound speaker with great bass for under $150\. Although the beta version of the app was lacking in features, that should be remedied when the app releases full compatibility for the Boom 2\. Plus, Soundcore's EQ settings are a valuable asset to any listening experience, and its waterproof capabilities make it an excellent option for outdoor music enthusiasts.

 Those looking for a different [Bluetooth speaker](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-highest-rated-phone-tripods/) at a lower price will find no shortage of options, but if you're concerned about outdoor elements like dust and dirt, you might want to consider something with an IPX67 rating, such as the [JBL Charge 5](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-channel-transformation-optimal-video-concepts-to-elevate-creativity/).
