## Top 5 Best No-Cost Offline Kart Racing Titles : Unveiling Our Picks

Close 

 One of the best innovations in free car racing video games has been the addition of online leaderboards, multiplayer races, and even persistent open worlds for players to explore in their virtual cars.

 However, these exciting features have a cost in that their implementation requires that the games be online at all times to function correctly.

 Thankfully, several good offline racing games are still worth playing on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming consoles. Here are ten free offline titles worth downloading today.

Gamesloft

 What We Like

* An impressive amount of content for a free game.
* Good variety of locations for each race track.

 What We Don't Like

* Younger players may tap in-game ads accidentally.
* The realistic art style may not appeal to all players.

 The Asphalt racing games are easily some of the most popular offline car games on iOS and Android._Asphalt 8: Airborne_ is one of the best in the series, as it features over 220 cars and bikes and lets players play entirely offline.

 A newer Asphalt game,_Asphalt 9: Legends_ , is available, but it requires a constant online connection.

_Asphalt 8: Airborne_ does contain an online multiplayer mode, but its single-player career mode is entirely playable without connecting to a Wi-Fi signal.

 What We Like
