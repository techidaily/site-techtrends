## Bypassing Barriers: Techniques for Handling TrustedInstaller on Windows 11 Systems
### What to Know

* Use the**TAKEOWN** and**icacls** Command Prompt commands to take ownership of the file or folder.
* Or, right-click the item and go to**Properties** \>**Security** \>**Advanced** to add yourself to the list.
* TrustedInstaller is a built-in user account that owns lots of important system files.

 This article describes two ways to deal with the message in Windows 10 about needing permission from TrustedInstaller to make changes to a file or folder.

## How to Fix the TrustedInstaller Error Using Command Prompt

 There are two really simple[Command Prompt commands](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-command-prompt-commands-4092302) you can use to bypass the TrustedInstaller permissions prompt. Follow these steps to fix the TrustedInstaller "error" by granting your user account permission to make changes to the file or folder:

1. [Open an elevated Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-an-elevated-command-prompt-2618088) . The quickest way there is to search for it from the Start menu, right-click the result, and choose**Run as administrator** .

2. Enter**TAKEOWN /F** and then type the file or folder name. Here's an example:  
 `TAKEOWN /F C:\Windows\System32\fr-FR\fms.dll.mui`
3. Press**Enter** to take control of the file. You'll see a success message if the command executed correctly.

4. Enter the following command (replacing our example file with your own) to immediately give your user account permission to delete or change the file or folder:  
 `icacls C:\Windows\System32\fr-FR\fms.dll.mui /grant Administrators:F /T`

## Why Do I Need Permission From TrustedInstaller?

 Provided you're the primary user of your home computer, you might be surprised to find out you need anyone’s permission to deal with files on your own PC.

 All Windows 10 PCs have an in-built Microsoft account known as the TrustedInstaller. This account exists to prevent accidental damage to important system files, so it's given ownership over many important operating system files. For you to be able to take control of these files, you need to make yourself the owner as described above.
