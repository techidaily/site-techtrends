## Easy Methods for Implementing Bots Into Your Server on Discord Platform

Close 

 The number of[ Discord](https://www.lifewire.com/discord-4174046) bots available for download continues to grow due to an active developer community. If you know how to add bots to Discord, there's a wide array of functionality you can take advantage of, from bots that play music to ones that facilitate donations.

##  How to Add Bots to Discord 

 Before you can add bots, you must[ create a Discord server](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-discord-server-5074624) . If you plan to add a bot to a server that's not yours, confirm that you've been granted permission to manage the server. These permissions are automatically in place for any server that you create.

1. [ Visit Discord Bots at top.gg](https://top.gg/) in your web browser.
2. Search for bots by keyword or browse the options available. Select**View** to learn more about a bot and add it to a server.

3. Select**Invite** . Discord launches automatically.

 If you're not logged in to Discord, you'll be prompted to do so now.
5. Ensure that all the permissions are selected, then select**Authorize** .

 You can deny a certain set of permissions by removing its check mark, but that will likely cause the bot to malfunction in certain instances.
6. Select the**I am human** check box.

##  Other Discord Bot Websites 

 Top.gg isn't the only place to find bots for your server. Other bot websites include:

* [ Bots on Discord](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/) : Useful tags and a Most Used Bots section make it easy to peruse some of the best options.
* [ Carbonitex](https://www.carbonitex.net/discord/bots) : This site's interface is a bit different from its competitors. Still, it provides access to a large number of feature-rich server additions.
* [ Discord Bots](https://discord.bots.gg/) : This easy-to-navigate repository of over 2,000 bots is worth browsing if you're in the market for some new additions to your server. A filter makes it a cinch to locate only open-source bots.

 As with any unregulated software, use caution when selecting a bot provider. High-trafficked sites with a significant number of reviews are typically more reputable than some of their lesser-known counterparts.

##  Adding Your Own Discord Bots to a Server 

 It's also possible to[ create your own Discord bots](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-discord-bot-4767916) and add them to a server instead of those developed by a third party. This gives you the freedom to customize them using JavaScript code and server-designated permissions. For example, you can set up an automated moderator bot that automatically bans problematic users.
