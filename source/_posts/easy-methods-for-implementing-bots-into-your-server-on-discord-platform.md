##  Other Discord Bot Websites 

 Top.gg isn't the only place to find bots for your server. Other bot websites include:

* [ Bots on Discord](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/) : Useful tags and a Most Used Bots section make it easy to peruse some of the best options.
* [ Carbonitex](https://www.carbonitex.net/discord/bots) : This site's interface is a bit different from its competitors. Still, it provides access to a large number of feature-rich server additions.
* [ Discord Bots](https://discord.bots.gg/) : This easy-to-navigate repository of over 2,000 bots is worth browsing if you're in the market for some new additions to your server. A filter makes it a cinch to locate only open-source bots.

 As with any unregulated software, use caution when selecting a bot provider. High-trafficked sites with a significant number of reviews are typically more reputable than some of their lesser-known counterparts.

##  Adding Your Own Discord Bots to a Server 

 It's also possible to[ create your own Discord bots](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-discord-bot-4767916) and add them to a server instead of those developed by a third party. This gives you the freedom to customize them using JavaScript code and server-designated permissions. For example, you can set up an automated moderator bot that automatically bans problematic users.
