## Complete Guide: Steps to Reboot Your Mac's Network Preferences
### What to Know

* **Wi-Fi** icon > your Wi-Fi name >**Details** \>**Forget This Network** \>**Remove** \> re-add your connection settings.
* Or:**/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/** \>**Go** \> delete select files.
* Macs don’t have an option called Reset Network Settings, though the steps above perform the same function.

 This article will walk you through the steps for how to reset network settings on a Mac. Unlike resetting network settings on an iPhone or Windows 10 computer, there’s no specific function on Macs for refreshing internet and wireless connection preferences, but it can still be done via the two methods shown below.

## How Do You Reset Network Settings in macOS?

 There are two different ways to reset the network settings on a Mac. The first method is relatively simple and should be tried first if you’re experiencing any connectivity or internet issues.

 The second process for resetting your network settings is safe, though it is a bit more complex and only recommended if the first method didn’t work.
