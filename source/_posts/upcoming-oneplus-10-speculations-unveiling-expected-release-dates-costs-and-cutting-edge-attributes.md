## OnePlus 10 Features

[OnePlus details new video shooting features](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/diving-deep-into-the-oneplus-10-pro-camera.1554663/) in the OnePlus 10 Pro, including one called Movie Mode. "By allowing you to adjust parameters such as white balance, shutter speed, and ISO before and during video capture, this mode gives you full control over your creative process." The company says this mode lets you opt into capturing in LOG format, which is said to make it easier for videographers to color grade their footage.

 There's also a neat Dual-View Video feature that lets you record from both the front and back-facing cameras simultaneouslyâ€”this is great for capturing your reaction during vlogs. Another feature is Extended Exposure, which lets you capture long exposure shots even if you don't have a tripod.

 More details about this phone's specs are below. It has better battery life than the OnePlus 9, the latest OxygenOS operating system, and a new PRO mode for RAW imaging formats.

 YouTuber Marques Brownlee provides a first look:

## OnePlus 10 Specs and Hardware

* 2nd-Gen Hasselblad camera with one billion colors.
* Fast charging with the 5,000 mAh battery.
* Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Mobile Platform.
* AMOLED display with LTPO, a dynamic refresh rate (120Hz to 1Hz), and 1300 nits peak brightness.
* OxygenOS 12 (based on[Android 12](https://www.lifewire.com/android-12-5184973) ).

 The OnePlus 10 Pro has the same screen size as the OnePlus 9 Pro: 6.7-inch display; however, it comes with just 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage (for the US model). There's a triple rear camera setup, the same as the previous iteration: 48MP primary camera, 8MP telephoto camera, and 50MP ultrawide camera with a maximum 150-degree field of view.

 Some things are improving, however. The 2022 OnePlus provides a bump in megapixels for the selfie camera, from 16MP to 32MP. The European and Indian variants come with 80W fast charging versus the OnePlus 9 Pro's 65W charging. OnePlus says the faster charging lets you power the whole phone through a cord in just over half an hour, or over wireless charging in under 50 minutes.

 It uses with the Snapdragon X65 modem, meaning it supports[5G](https://www.lifewire.com/5g-wireless-4155905) , with maximum download speeds of 10 Gbps. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Qualcomm chipset is said to perform 20% better, with a 30% bump in power efficiency, over the previous iteration.

 The OnePlus 10 Pro has Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection and is available in two colors: Volcanic Black and Emerald Forest.
