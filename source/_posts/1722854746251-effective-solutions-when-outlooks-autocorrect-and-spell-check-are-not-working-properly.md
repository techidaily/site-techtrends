## Effective Solutions When Outlook's AutoCorrect and Spell Check Are Not Working Properly

Close 

 When spell check isn't working in Outlook, you might overlook a mistake that could be unprofessional or embarrassing. Below are the most common causes of this issue and a list of ways you can fix it quickly.

 These solutions apply to Outlook for Microsoft 365, Outlook 2021, Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013, and Outlook 2010.

##  Why the Spell Check in Outlook Is Not Working 

 This handy feature saves you from embarrassing misspelling blunders, but only when it works. Here are some factors that can make Outlook's spell check tool misfire or stop working:

* A temporary glitch broke the spell checker
* Some necessary settings are switched off
* The wrong language is chosen
* An add-in is interfering with spell check
* The Outlook installation is corrupt

 If you're using Outlook in your web browser, you should know that[ Outlook.com does not have a built-in spell checker](https://www.lifewire.com/hotmail-spell-checker-1174278) . Instead, install a browser extension like Grammarly or enable the spell checker built into your computer (in Windows, search Settings for**Highlight misspelled words** ).

##  How to Fix Outlook Spell Check Not Working 

 Follow these solutions in the order we've listed them to try the easier fixes first.

1. Close Outlook and then reopen it. This is a good first step because it doesn't take long. A temporary glitch in the software or on your computer can break the spell check functionality.
2. Check Outlook's AutoCorrect options. Spell check won't work if something is misconfigured or turned off. Go to**File** \>**Options** \>**Mail** to review these settings.  
 For example, if spell check didn't catch a mistake when you sent a message, ensure**Always check spelling before sending** is turned on. In the**Spelling and Autocorrect** options are several other settings that, if turned off, will make spell check stop working, like**Check spelling as you type** and**Mark grammar errors as you type** .

3. Change the proofing language. A language variation could make it seem as though the spell check tool is not working correctly. For instance, UK English and US English spell many words slightly differently. Go to**File** \>**Options** \>**Language** section to see how your app is set up.
4. Run spell check manually. Enter multiple misspelled words into a new message, then select**Review** \>**Spelling and Grammar** . This lets you see if spell check is working at all.
5. Turn on connected experiences. When disabled, Microsoft Editor can't check your grammar. It's easy to switch on: Go to**File** \>**Options** \>**General** \>**Privacy Settings** and then check the box next to**Turn on experiences that analyze your content** .
6. Check if spell check ignores certain parts of your emails. If Outlook is set to ignore areas in replies and forwarded messages, it may cause the tool to not work. Go to**File** \>**Options** \>**Mail** and clear the**Ignore original message text in reply or forward** option.
7. [ Open Outlook in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/outlook-safe-mode-4164302) . If spell check is fixed in Safe Mode, uninstall any recently added add-ins. They are the most likely reason spell check doesn't work.
8. [ Update Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/check-and-enable-updates-outlook-1173646) . There might be an update from Microsoft that fixes whatever problem is causing spell check not to work.
9. Repair Outlook. If there's a bigger problem at play, repairing the program should fix it. In Windows 11, go to**Settings** \>**Apps** \>**Installed apps** , and then select the**three dots** \>**Advanced options** \>**Repair** .
10. [ Reinstall Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . This should be the fix if none of the above has worked.
