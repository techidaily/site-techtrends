## Binkw32.dll Missing? Here's How You Can Quickly Resolve This Common Error
 Depending on what game happens to be experiencing this problem, you could see the error in nearly any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) from Windows 95 all the way through more recent versions like[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , and[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) .  

## How to Fix Binkw32.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.  

 Do not download binkw32.dll individually from any "DLL download site." There are many reasons[why downloading DLLs like that is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of the file, it's always best to obtain it from its legitimate, original source.

1. Close and reopen the game program that generated the binkw32.dll error. Whatever game you're playing may be having a temporary problem that a restart might fix.
2. [Download and install the RAD Video Tools](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm) to possibly replace the missing or corrupt file.  
 The download comes in the form of a 7Z file, so you'll need[7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) on your computer to open it. There's also a password listed on the download page that you'll need when opening it.
3. [Reinstall the game](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Since the error involves a video codec that should have been included inside your game installation, reinstalling the entire game is likely to resolve the problem.  
 Even if you're not asked, be sure to[restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) after the uninstall and before the reinstall. Restarting your computer at this point will ensure that any loaded files are cleared from[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and that the uninstallation is 100 percent complete.
4. Download the latest update to the game. Visit the game designer's website and download the latest[service pack](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) ,[patch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) , or another update for your particular game.  
 In many cases, even with some instances of the "procedure entry point \_BinkSetVolume@12" and related errors, the binkw32.dll error may have been corrected in a game update.
5. [Copy the binkw32.dll file from your game's _System_ directory to your game's root directory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) . In some games, the file is placed in the wrong directory when the game is installed.  
 For example, if your game is installed in_C:\\Program Files\\Game_ , copy the file from_C:\\Program Files\\Game\\System_ folder to the game's[root folder](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-root-folder-or-root-directory-2625989) at_C:\\Program Files\\Game_ .
6. Copy the binkw32.dll file to your Windows _System_ directory. Some people experiencing these errors have fixed this problem by copying the binkw32.dll file from its location in the game's installation folder to the_C:\\Windows\\System_ folder.
7. Copy the binkw32.dll file from the game's disc to the program's installation folder. If you can't find the DLL file from the game's _System_ folder or the Windows _System_ folder, or copying that DLL didn't work, the next best place to get it is from the original CD.  
 For example, if the error presents itself while playing_Age of Empires III_ , open the disc from File Explorer and find the_Disk1C\~1.cab_  file. Open that[CAB](https://www.lifewire.com/cab-file-4144227) file and copy the binkw32.dll file from there to the game's installation folder, which in this case is probably_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Games\\Age of Empires III._  
 In most cases, you want to copy the DLL file to whatever folder has the game's primary application file, usually an[EXE](https://www.lifewire.com/exe-file-2622732) file that's used to start the game each time it's opened from a shortcut. You can find this folder by right-clicking a shortcut to the game (usually on the Desktop) and choosing the option to open the file's location.
8. Is the game pirated? In most cases, the "procedure entry point \_BinkSetVolume@12" and related errors only appear when running an illegal version of a game. If this is the case, our only recommendation here is to purchase the game and try again.
9. Upgrade your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) . It's a less common reason, but in some cases, the "procedure entry point \_BinkSetVolume@12" error and others like it are caused by running a game on a computer system with an inferior video card. Upgrading the card to one with more memory and processing power could resolve the problem.  
 Visit the game designer's website and find out what the minimum video card requirements are for the game you're trying to play. You'll want to make sure you're buying a powerful enough card to play the game.

## Causes of Binkw32.dll Errors

 Binkw32.dll errors are caused by issues that the particular game you're trying to install or play is having with the Bink Video codec created by[Epic Games Tools (i.e., RAD Game Tools)](http://www.radgametools.com/) .

 Most of the time, the "procedure entry point" errors involving binkw32.dll are due to running "cracked" versions of games. You may see this error when trying to run a game without the original CD or DVD, something commonly done with illegally downloaded games.

 Many popular PC games use the Bink Video codec. Your game may use the codec (and thus the binkw32[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) ) even if you've never installed anything from RAD Game Tools.

![Binkw32 DLL Error Message in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zYf95q6hVZ_rYLRzH5ocfYfAzNM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/binkw32-dll-error-message-585811475f9b586e029b6930.png)

 There are many ways that the error might show up on your computer. Most of the time, it's telling you that you're missing the DLL file.

 Below are some of the more common variations of the error:

* **Missing BINKW32.DLL**
* **Binkw32.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because BINKW32.DLL was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find binkw32.dll!**
* **An attempt to delay-load a .dll or get a function address in a delay-loaded .dll failed. Dll: binkw32.dll**
* **This program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem**

 Even after replacing the binkw32.dll file, some users will receive one of these related errors or another like it:

* **The procedure entry point \_BinkSetVolume@12 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll.**
* **The procedure entry point \_BinkSetMemory@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll.**

 The file is not _blinkw32_ , but _binkw32_ (without an "L"). You might see a lot of references online to_blink_ instead of_bink_ , but they're just typos.

 The error message could apply to any PC video game that utilizes the Bink Video codec.

 Some common games that may generate these errors include _Age of Conan, Dungeon Lords, Civilization III, Demon Stone, Battlefield 2142, Battlefield 1942, Age of Empires III, Dungeon Siege II, World in Conflict, Sid Meier's Pirates!, Broken Sword 4, Ragnarok, BioShock, Battlefield Vietnam, Empire Earth II, DarkRO, Hitman: Blood Money, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,_ and_Star Wars: Battlefront II, Tomb Raider: Legend_ .
