## Open Command Prompt in Windows 11 or 10

 There are a few ways, but using the search bar on the taskbar is one quick method for opening a command window.

 Directions differ between Windows versions. See[What Version of Windows Do I Have?](https://www.lifewire.com/what-version-of-windows-do-i-have-2624927) if you're not sure.

1. Select the**Start** **menu** (the Windows icon) on the taskbar, or press the**Windows key** .
2. Type**cmd** .
3. Select**Command Prompt** from the list.

 If you're using the latest version of Windows 11, Command Prompt will open within[Terminal](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-terminal-4779951) .

 Some popular Command Prompt commands you might have heard of include[ping](https://www.lifewire.com/ping-command-2618099) ,[netstat](https://www.lifewire.com/netstat-command-2618098) ,[tracert](https://www.lifewire.com/tracert-command-2618101) ,[shutdown](https://www.lifewire.com/shutdown-command-2618100) , and[attrib](https://www.lifewire.com/attrib-command-2625802) , but there are_many_ more. We have a[complete list of Windows Command Prompt commands](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-command-prompt-commands-4092302) .

### Open Command Prompt Through the Start Menu Folder

 Another way to open the Windows Command Prompt in Windows 10 is to look in its Start menu folder. Open the**Start menu** , select the**Windows System** folder from the list, and then choose**Command Prompt** from the folder group.

### Open Command Prompt Using Power User Menu

 One more method is through the[Power User Menu](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-power-user-menu-2625968) . If you're using a keyboard or mouse, choose**Terminal** (Windows 11) or**Command Prompt** (Windows 10) from the menu that appears after pressing**Win** +**X** or right-clicking the**Start** **Menu** .

![Command Prompt in Windows 10 Power User menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7_8z-AOur7jJSd6_2bz9Yp2VnDA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089-5c646ad746e0fb0001dcd81a.jpg)

 You might see PowerShell options in the Power User Menu instead of Command Prompt. In more recent versions of Windows 10, Command Prompt has been replaced by PowerShell, but you can[switch between PowerShell and Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/switch-command-prompt-and-powershell-on-the-win-x-menu-2626247) from the Power User Menu. Terminal is the replacement in Windows 11.

## Open Command Prompt in Windows 8 or 8.1

 You'll find Command Prompt in Windows 8 through the Apps screen.

1. Select the**Windows** **Start** button and then swipe up to show the**Apps** screen. You can accomplish the same thing with a mouse by selecting the down arrow icon at the bottom of the screen.  
 If you're using a keyboard or mouse, a really quick way to open a Command Prompt window in Windows 8 is through the Power User Menuâ€”hold the**WIN** and**X** keys down together, or right-click the**Start** button, and choose**Command Prompt** .  
 Before[the Windows 8.1 update](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-to-windows-8-1-2626252) , the_Apps_ screen can be accessed from the_Start_ screen by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, or right-clicking anywhere, and then choosing**All apps** .
2. Swipe or scroll to the right on the Apps screen to locate the**Windows System** section heading.
3. Select**Command Prompt** . You can now execute whatever command you needed to run.

 See our [list of Windows 8 Command Prompt commands](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-command-prompt-commands-4172073) for all of the commands available through Command Prompt in Windows 8, including short descriptions and links to more in-depth information if we have it.

## Open Command Prompt in Windows 7, Vista, or XP

 In these versions of Windows, Command Prompt is found through a folder group in the Start menu.

1. Open the**Start** **Menu** in the bottom-left corner of the screen.  
 In Windows 7 and Windows Vista, it's a bit faster to enter**command** in the search box at the bottom of the Start menu and then choose**Command Prompt** when it appears in the results.
2. Go to**All Programs** \>**Accessories** .
3. Choose**Command Prompt** from the list of programs.

 See our [list of Windows 7 commands](https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-windows-7-command-prompt-commands-4107370) and[list of Windows XP commands](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-commands-4687695) if you need a command reference for any of those versions of Windows.

## Other Ways to Open Command Prompt

 Command Prompt in Windows 11 through Windows XP can also be opened with a command. This is especially helpful if you like using the Run dialog box or if File Explorer has crashed and the Start menu is inaccessible (and thus the directions above don't work).

 To do this, enter**cmd** into the command-line interface. This can be in the Run dialog box (**WIN** +**R** ) or[Task Manager's](https://www.lifewire.com/task-manager-2626025) **Run new task** option (go to**File** \>**Run new task** if you're not using Windows 11).

## Elevated Command Prompts and Old Windows Versions

 Command Prompt doesn't exist in versions of Windows released before Windows XP, like Windows 98 and Windows 95\. However, the older and very similar MS-DOS Prompt does. This program is located in the Start menu and can be opened with the**command** run command.

 Some commands, like the[sfc command](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) that's used to repair Windows files, require that Command Prompt be opened_as an administrator_ before they can be executed. You'll know if this is the case if you get a message like one of these after trying to execute the command:

* **check that you have administrative rights**
* **... command can only be executed from an elevated command prompt**
* **you must be an administrator**

 See[How to Open an Elevated Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-an-elevated-command-prompt-2618088) for help starting Command Prompt as an administrator, a process that's a bit more complicated than what's outlined above.
