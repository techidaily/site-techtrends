ABBYY, a global leader in Digital IQ technologies and solutions, will join other enterprise and technology innovators at [The AI Summit Hong Kong](https://hongkong.theaisummit.com/ "The AI Summit Hong Kong") on August 7-8, 2019\. The company will showcase its content and process intelligence solutions following the recent expansion of its technology portfolio and global presence.

During his keynote presentation Digital Intelligence: using AI to better understand business, ABBYY Chief Innovation Officer Anthony Macciola will outline ABBYY’s new global positioning and strategy following the [acquisition of the AI startup TimelinePI](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190520005201/en/ABBYY-Announces-Agreement-Acquire-TimelinePI-Deliver-Digital) and the [opening of the Hong Kong office](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-07-16/abbyy-opens-office-in-hong-kong-to-strengthen-presence-in-asia).

"The intelligence of your enterprise sits within your content, but you need the IQ to harness it,” comments Anthony Macciola leading up to his keynote. “As organizations mature in their digital transformation journey, they will need more insight into the efficiencies of their business processes through process intelligence. The ability to understand enterprise content in all its forms within the context of critical processes is a level of digital intelligence that enterprises will need in order for their digital transformation to be successful."
