* You can also use the Apple Support app, which is a better option if you have several Apple devices.

## How to Schedule an Appointment From the Apple Support App

 The Apple Support app provides troubleshooting and contact information, and it's the fastest way to get a Genius Bar appointment, especially if you own several Apple devices.

1. In the Apple Support app, sign in with your Apple ID if you receive a prompt.
2. Choose the device you're having trouble with under**My Devices** .
3. Choose the issue you're facing. For this example, we'll act like our screen is broken, which falls under**Repairs & Physical Damage** , but you might also use**Device Performance** if you think you have a software issue.
4. Select the specific problem from the next screen.

## Using the Apple Store App to Make Appointments

 Another way to book an appointment is through the Apple Store app, but it has a few more steps.  

1. Tap your**profile image** on the**Shop** tab in the Apple Store app.
2. Select**Reservations** .
3. On the next screen, tap**Find a store** .  
![Profile pic, Reservations option, and Find a Store in the Apple Store app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/McTZyDh1dHEy4jPR7CZmGNKvI5k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Store-App-Appointment-01-9cacdcf93f3a41d3851b1a2cca991204.jpg)
4. Search for your closest Apple Store, or select one under**Nearby Stores** .
5. Choose**Make a reservation** under**Genius Bar** .
6. You'll go to Apple's support website, where you can describe your problem in the box under**Tell us what's happening** .  
 If you have the Apple Support app on your phone, the Apple Store app will direct you there instead of the website.  
![A Store, the "Make a reservation" link, and the "Tell us what's happening" field in the Apple Store app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ircG1uYJS77_UHCiiZH0GISmswg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Store-App-Appointment-02-e508d0091eb04923ba10576b908d07ad.jpg)
7. Depending on your device's issue, the app may ask you clarifying questions. Eventually, you'll see an option to**Schedule a repair** . Choose**Find a location** to continue.
8. If you're signed in to your Apple ID on the Support site, you can choose one of your devices. You can also select**Continue without device** if you like, or enter a serial number.
9. Find your Apple Store on the map.

10. Pick a day and time using the calculator and drop-down menu.
11. Optionally, enter your phone number if you want a representative from the Apple Store to call you. Tap**Continue** .
12. Review your reservation date and time, and then select**Reserve now** to confirm.
