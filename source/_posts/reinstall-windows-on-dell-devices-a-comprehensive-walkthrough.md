 Keep your laptop connected to a power source through the entire reset and reinstallation process.

### Windows 11 Steps

 Here's how this works in Windows 11:  

1. Open**Settings** from the Start menu or by pressing**Win** +**i** .

### Windows 10 Steps

 Although Windows 10 looks a little different, the steps for resetting your Dell PC are basically the same.  

1. Search for**reset** from the Start menu and select**Reset this PC** when you see that option in the results.  
![Reset this PC highlighted in Windows 10 Search Result](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w322knvWAY5LS3g2ijD9Lo-WW7g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Reset-This-PC-6b112a58f46e405e94ea393de2bbe622-1456912db2a6436b9e0e3ed71a557f06.jpg)
2. Under**Reset this PC** , select**Get started** .  
![Get Started button highlighted for Reset this PC](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M12BhAylYUYxIRH8BaYkjPh3cH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GetStartedannotated-aa6108a0a5fa406080cc54262b3d8906.jpg)
3. Select **Remove everything** to wipe the Dell laptop clean and reinstall Windows. This step is the nuclear option, as it removes your files, all custom settings, and any apps your PC manufacturer installed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Alternatively, select **Keep my files** to reinstall Windows and keep your personal files, like videos, documents, images, desktop items, etc.  
![Choose an option on Reset this PC dialog](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6vfzk6J_HtOj8H7T3tUwAWzqdwc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Reset-This-PC-Dell-Laptop-Choose-Option-1bf5704819b84008a4331b6bcd991a47.jpg)  
 If your Windows came with pre-installed Dell apps, these manufacturer apps will be restored.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. When asked how to download the OS, select**Cloud download** if you're connected to the internet. Cloud download is helpful if your local copy of Windows is corrupted.  
 Otherwise, choose**Local reinstall** to reinstall Windows from your device. This option makes for a faster installation and doesn't require an active internet connection.  
![Reinstall Windows Choice Screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BSKyYJa8z6rwNwXiaXM7n9YYnjY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Resinstall-Windows-Choices-80a92105c9e34e6b891d883150d5bc49.jpg)
5. Select **Change settings** for additional options.  
![Reset this PC Additional Settings with Change Settings highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YNxIyOubi5d_yfZeAc7MC2KVY0A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ChangeSettings-a0c30ea2d39244f985bc63510072333e.jpg)  
 By default, Reset this PC will remove your files but doesn't securely erase them. It also only deletes data from the drive where you have Windows installed.

6. Toggle on the switch for**Clean data?** to have Windows wipe everything on the drive securely and reduce the chances of data recovery. This process will take time but will make any sensitive data unrecoverable. It's not necessary if you don't plan to give away your laptop.  
![Clean my data switch toggle highlighted in the Choose Settings screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RxENIQz6Szpjl7Ln7hD3yEkzrzw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/CleanDatatoggle-3f12ed4ff3f3414098d30869b251b4af.jpg)
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the reset process. It can take an hour or more, and your computer will restart a few times before it's all finished.

## How to Reset a Dell Laptop From the ASO Menu

 Another way to reset your laptop is through the[Advanced Start Options menu](https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-options-2625805) . This works from outside of Windows, but otherwise will perform the same function of wiping your computer.

1. [Access the Advanced Startup Options menu](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-access-advanced-startup-options-in-windows-10-or-8-2626229) . There are a few ways to get there, all detailed in that guide, but the easiest way is to hold**Shift** while pressing the**Restart** option from the Start menu or lock screen.
2. Select**Troubleshoot** on the first screen.  
![Troubleshoot highlighted in WinRE Screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xP84RJIU-KCXCyOyheyj9g2gnaY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Troubleshoot-a8617bc95f2040f9858f68ee56839218.jpg)
3. Select**Reset this PC** .

4. Choose either**Keep my files** or**Remove everything** .  
![Windows Recovery Environment](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0193C72O0bxYFJhlP4NZetVlIsc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Windows10-WinRE-Remove-Everything-10e8c706f03f4f8e9f7a318ad09c1dc9.jpg)
5. Pick how Windows should be reinstalled. We recommend choosing**Cloud download** , but if your computer's files are corrupt or you don't have a stable internet connection,**Local reinstall** works fine, too.

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the reset process. This takes some time, and your computer will restart.

## What Is a Factory Reset?

 Wiping a Dell laptop is the final troubleshooting solution when things go wrong with Windows. It's also a recommended step when you want to give away your old laptop.

 A factory reset restores a PC to the same state it was in when it rolled out of the manufacturer’s assembly line. Almost all electronic devices have this capability, and you can't undo it once you start. A Windows factory reset will wipe your Dell laptop of all installed programs and files, so if you don't want to lose all your data, it's best to back up your files first.

 Windows will work like new once all the updates are in place. But there are two points to consider:

* A factory reset alone won’t solve all performance issues since some problems are hardware related.
* A factory reset will wipe data from the hard drive, but this data may still be recoverable with[data recovery software](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .

## How Do I Delete Everything Off My Dell Laptop?

 The above methods help you keep your operating system intact while giving you the choice of a clean Windows installation. There may be situations, however, where you would want to delete Windows. Maybe there's sensitive data on your Dell PC, and you want to make it unrecoverable before you sell the laptop or scrap it. Also, wiping the hard drive clean might be one of the options to remove ransomware from your compromised PC.

 You can[wipe your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-wipe-a-hard-drive-2624527) with the help of native and third-party specialized tools. This is extreme and will delete everything from your laptop, making it virtually impossible for any file recovery program to reconstruct the data. The formatting methods don't depend on the make or model of the Windows laptop you own.

 FAQ

* How would I wipe my Dell Laptop if I've forgotten my administrator password?  
 For a Windows 11, 10, or 8 Dell laptop, you don't need an admin password to reset the device to factory settings. From the Start menu, access**Reset This PC** and follow the instructions.
* How would I wipe a Dell laptop running Windows 7?  
 To wipe and factory reset your Windows 7 Dell laptop, boot up the device and go to**Control Panel** \>**System and Security** \>**System** . Select**System Protection** \>**System Restore** . Choose**Recommended Restore** to opt for the most recent restore point, then select**Next** \>**Finish** . Select**Yes** to start the restore process.
