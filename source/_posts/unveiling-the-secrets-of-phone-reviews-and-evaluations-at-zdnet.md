## Top-Ranking iPhone Choices : Comprehensive Expert Evaluations & Reviews

If you're shopping for an iPhone, you may be asking yourself a combination (or all) of the following questions: How much storage should I buy? Should I buy an older model for less money? Is the "Pro" model worth it? And should I spring for the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/)? That's because the iPhone lineup is more convoluted than ever, with Apple now offering a total of 13 models, not counting the refurbished ones, on its website and in stores, with the arrival of the new [iPhone 16 line](https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-is-the-iphone-16-coming-out-what-to-know-and-where-to-preorder/).

## iPhone 15 Pro Max

### Best iPhone overall

The best iPhone overall is the iPhone 15 Pro Max. While it launched in September of last year, the 6.7-inch model is still the largest iPhone Apple currently offers. It has the latest features, including support for future [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/) tools in iOS 18\. 

The iPhone 15 Pro Max looks and feels different than prior Pro Max models, as it's made of titanium instead of stainless steel. This material choice "makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable," ZDNET's editor-in-chief, [Jason Hiner](https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-hiner/), noted when first reviewing the phone.

**Review:**[**iPhone 15 Pro: Coming from iPhone 12 Pro or earlier? This upgrade will wow you**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-pro-review/)

Another major feature of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the [USB-C connector](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-cables-for-the-iphone-15/). While that may sound underwhelming, the switch from Lightning means the iPhone now supports faster charging and data transfers, the ability to charge AirPods and other USB-C accessories, and the ability to connect to an external 4K monitor. Some users on Reddit even suggest that the switch to USB-C was what brought them back to the iPhone.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max also features a new 5x zoom camera lens -- the equivalent of a 120mm focal length on a mirrorless or DSLR camera -- a new Action button that lets you better customize shortcuts and easily open the apps you need, and an A17 Pro chip that's snappier and more capable of handling machine-learning, on-background tasks than other iPhone models.

**iPhone 15 Pro Max specs:** **Processor:** Apple A17 Pro Bionic | **Display size:** 6.7 inches with 120Hz refresh rate | **Storage options:** 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | **Rear cameras:** 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, and 12MP 5x telephoto | **Front camera:** 12MP | **Colors:** Natural Titanium, Blue, White, Black | **Weight:** 221g | **Starting price:** $1,099

## Apple iPhone 15

### Best iPhone for most people

The iPhone 15 looks great, feels great, and performs how a premium phone should. It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 15 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumers. With this model, Apple has also given it USB-C charging, though the phone tops up at a slower pace (18W instead of 30W), the Dynamic Island for multitasking, and a matte back design that's less prone to fingerprint marks -- putting it closer to the Pro version than ever. 

The iPhone 15 offers a thinner, slightly lighter form factor than its predecessor, the iPhone 14, whether you opt for the standard size or Plus. When I reviewed the model at launch, I was very impressed by how the curved edges gave me a confident grip without digging deeply into my palm. That's been a pain point with older iPhone models, which flaunted sharper, glossier designs.

**Review:** [**iPhone 15: Why I recommend this model even to 'Pro' users in 2024**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/)

Apple also gave the latest iPhone a promising camera upgrade, with a new 48MP main sensor that lets you crop into photos and retain more detail and color accuracy than ever. As pulled from my review, "the iPhone's color science leans more natural, prioritizing the finer details like subjects underneath shadows and how evenly lit everything in the frame is."

Pair the reliable camera with great battery life, a reliable A16 Bionic chip, and a swatch of charming colors, and you have an iPhone that most people can buy and enjoy. Best Buy customers seem to agree with that sentiment, commending the iPhone 15's camera quality, endurance, and overall performance.

**iPhone 15 specs: Processor:** Apple A16 Bionic | **Display size:** 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | **Storage options:** 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | **Rear cameras:** 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | **Front camera:** 12MP | **Colors:** Pink, Yellow, Blue, Green, Black | **Weight:** 171g | **Starting price:** $799

Pros 
* Last iPhone Mini model you can buy
* Identical internals to the iPhone 13
* Size doesn't compromise on performance and camera quality

Cons 
* No high refresh rate display
* Subpar battery life
* Shorter software update schedule
* Need to buy refurbished

## Apple iPhone 13 Mini

### Best small iPhone

While Apple has officially [discontinued its iPhone Mini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-mini-is-dead-long-live-the-iphone-plus/) models, Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential, suggests the iPhone 13 Mini for anyone eyeing a small flagship iPhone. He's not wrong: The iPhone 13 Mini is the only compact option in the US that includes specs similar to that of its larger siblings. You'll just have to buy one refurbished, as the company no longer sells the smaller size in stores.

**Review: [Apple iPhone 13 Mini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-mini-lives-the-case-for-buying-it-in-2022/)**

For roughly $350 at major retailers, the iPhone 13 Mini comes with the same A15 Bionic processor as the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14, as well as Face ID, 5G, wireless charging, and a reliable set of cameras. If you find yourself taking advantage of the dual 12MP rear cameras, the base storage of 128GB (upgradeable up to 512GB) should be sufficient for creative needs.

The iPhone SE (2022) is the other contender for small iPhones, but its outdated design makes the iPhone 13 Mini the more practical choice in the modern age of digital consumption. Speaking of which, there are some obvious drawbacks to the smaller form factor, like battery life, display quality, and multitasking. But if you can shoulder the three, like several satisfied Reddit users, the iPhone 13 Mini is definitively the best mini iPhone available right now.

**iPhone 13 Mini specs: Processor:** Apple A15 | **Display size:** 5.4 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | **Storage options:** 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | **Rear cameras:** Two 12MP (wide and ultra-wide) | **Front camera:** 12MP | **Colors:** Starlight, Midnight, Red, Pink, Blue | **Weight:** 141g | **Starting Price:** $350

Pros 
* It's an iPhone... for $429
* Solid battery life
* Excellent software support
* Smallest form factor of any iPhone
* IP67 dust/water resistant

Cons 
* Outdated design
* Display may come off as cramped for some
* Not the most flexible camera system

## Apple iPhone SE (2022)

### Best cheap iPhone

Going off of retail price alone, the 2022 iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now. The $429 starting price comes with its caveats, of course, but there are still several iPhone benefits that may interest budget shoppers.

**Review: [Apple iPhone SE (2022)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/)**

For example, the latest model brings Sub-6 5G support ([mmWave is not supported](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iphone-se-doesnt-support-5g-mmwave-bands-and-thats-okay/)) and an improved A15 processor with the same 4.7-inch display size, front Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and single rear camera as the older iPhone 8 model. If you were a fan of the pre-notch era of iPhones, the iPhone SE will scratch that old-time itch.

The A15 processor, compared to its predecessor's A13, brings improved performance, longer battery life, and enhanced photography results, as tested 's former contributor [Jason Cipriani](https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-cipriani/). "The lone 12-megapixel camera is no slouch. While Apple didn't upgrade the hardware itself, the camera benefits from the A15 Bionic processor and its image signal processor," he noted in his review.

**iPhone SE specs:** **CPU:** Apple A15 | **Display:** 4.7 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | **Internal storage:** 64GB, 128GB, 256GB | **Rear cameras:** 12MP wide | **Front camera:** 7MP | **Colors:** Midnight, Starlight, Red | **Weight:** 144g | **Starting price** **:** $429

Pros 
* Goldilocks size for iPhones
* Pro-level camera system
* Improved repairability
* Identical software support as the more-expensive Pro models

Cons 
* Still 60Hz display
* Doesn't have a telephoto lens
* U.S. customers are locked to eSIM

## Apple iPhone 14

### Best old-generation iPhone

While Apple continues to segment its iPhone line with "Pro" and "Plus" models, the regular offering, such as the previous generation's iPhone 14, continues to be successful. Part of the reason is how similar its design is to the Pro variant, especially regarding form factor, button placement, and even the charging tech. 

But the more obvious reason is the price. The permanent price reduction makes the iPhone 14 the "best old-generation iPhone" for now. Originally selling for $799, the 2022 iPhone can now be had for $699 at your local Apple store.

**Review: [Apple iPhone 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-14-review/)**

For folks who are not as invested in the latest camera features and hardware, which is most people, the price difference is enough to justify buying the regular iPhone 14 instead of one of the Pro models or even the latest iPhone 15\. That doesn't mean you're settling for an inferior iPhone experience. With its A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 14 should power you through general tasks like social media browsing, emailing, video calls, gaming, and then some. 

The iPhone 14's dual camera system at the rear has been carried over from the iPhone 13 Pro, which, if you read [our full review](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-13-pro-max/), should give you confidence more than anything else. If you do buy the iPhone 14 (or any older phone model), it's always helpful to replace the battery so that you have a full-health cell to work with, making the phone feel like new again.

**iPhone 14 specs: Processor:** Apple A15 | **Display size:** 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | **Storage options:** 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | **Rear cameras:** Dual 12MP (Wide, ultra-wide) | **Front camera:** 12MP | **Colors:** Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Red | **Weight:** 172g | **Starting price:** $699

## What is the best iPhone?

After weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It's got a beautiful AMOLED display, a powerful (and future-proofed) chipset, and a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 15 Pro Max is also Apple's most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the standard 15 Pro and even older models. 

| **iPhone models compared** | **Base Price** | **Base Storage** | **Display** | **Processor** | **Cameras** **(rear)** |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| iPhone 15 Pro Max          | $1,099         | 128GB            | 6.7 inches  | A17           | Three                  |
| iPhone 15                  | $799           | 128GB            | 6.1 inches  | A16           | Two                    |
| iPhone 14                  | $699           | 128GB            | 6.1 inches  | A15           | Two                    |
| iPhone 13 Mini             | $480           | 128GB            | 5.4 inches  | A15           | Two                    |
| iPhone SE (3rd Generation) | $429           | 64GB             | 4.7 inches  | A15           | One                    |

## Are iPhones the best smartphone?

The answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the [Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review/) is ZDNET's pick for [best phone of 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/) (for now), it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems.

Previously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa.

## Which iPhone model is right for you?

It used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the "big" iPhone or the "small" one. With four models available in the iPhone 15 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision. 

Size is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone. 

One fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time.

| **Choose this iPhone...**        | **If you want...**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max          | The top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, will also support Apple's upcoming AI features. |
| Apple iPhone 15                  | A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 15 should be more than enough.                                                                                                            |
| Apple iPhone SE (3rd Generation) | The iPhone SE is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, outdated form factor, but the performance makes up for it.                                                                       |
| Apple iPhone 13 Mini             | The only iPhone Mini that Apple makes. This is arguably the best compact smartphone money can buy, even if it's nearly three years old.                                                                                                 |
| Apple iPhone 14                  | An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 14 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less.                                                                                                  |

## Factors to consider when choosing an iPhone

We chose these smartphones by testing them for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos. 

ZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for.

* **Display**: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget - puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.
* **Performance**: One of iPhones' biggest strengths is their in-house silicon, namely the A-series of Apple chipsets. Thanks to this mingling of proprietary hardware and software, we've found the latest iPhones very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services.
* **Camera quality**: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best iPhones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.
* **Battery life**: For how reliant we've become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but also support fast charging when it's time to top up.
* **Price**: What you won't find on this list is a device that's not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you're getting.

## How we test iPhones

ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:

* **Design and ergonomics:** How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.
* **Performance:** Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.
* **Camera quality:** ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.
* **Battery life and charging:** It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).
* **Special features:** These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.
* **Pricing and availability:** Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.

### How do I take care of my new iPhone?

There are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine. 

1. One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The [best iPhone cases](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-15-case/) offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in [multi-packs for less than $10](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAilun-Protector-Installation-Friendly-Tempered%2Fdp%2FB0CCYN42DL%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce2e7d2e8-670c-4557-a8a5-df99a5abb5ff%7Cdtp&dtb=1).
2. Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician.
3. As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.

### When is iOS 18 coming, and will my iPhone support it?

The upcoming software version for the iPhone is currently in its [public beta phase](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-ios-18-beta-on-your-iphone-right-now-heres-how-and-which-models-support-it/), meaning it's open for any users to test. The official software will be available to download on September 16, alongside the [new iPhone 16 series](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-three-changes-i-want-to-see-on-the-next-apple-handsets/) that arrives September 20.

Like iOS 17, iPhone models as old as the XR will be eligible to receive the [iOS 18 update](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-cant/). The list includes the iPhone 11 to iPhone 15 series and the iPhone SE (2nd generation or later). What's not included is the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series. Those, unfortunately, won't be receiving any more operating system updates.

### What is the new iPhone?

The latest iPhone is the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-is-the-iphone-16-coming-out-what-to-know-and-where-to-preorder/), announced on Monday, September 9, during [Apple's "It's Glowtime" event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-we-expect-at-apples-iphone-16-event-ai-features-airpods-apple-watch-series-10-more/). There are four iPhone 16 models: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. All will come with iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence built in.

### Which iPhone is better, 14 or 15?

Between the two latest generations of iPhones, here are the key reasons to buy one over the other:

**You should buy the iPhone 15 if...**

* You want the best camera system on an iPhone
* You want an iPhone that will last you for more than a day; the iPhone 15 Plus is great for this
* The USB-C port makes life easier for you, especially if you own similarly-supported devices

**You should buy the iPhone 14 if...**

* You can find a good deal on a used, second-hand model
* You prefer having the lightning port

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Lightning port vs. USB-C

One of the biggest upgrades with the latest iPhone 15 series is the [USB-C port](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-15s-usb-c-upgrade-may-have-serious-implications-for-the-charging-accessory-future/), a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard. 

**Also: [Best USB-C chargers and accessories for iPhone 15 Pro: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-and-wireless-chargers-and-accessories-for-iphone-15-pro/)**

Otherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data.

### Which iPhone models support Apple's new AI features?

Apple's upcoming AI features, branded as "[Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/)," are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means only the iPhone 15 Pro series, excluding the standard iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, will support the new AI tools and the upcoming iPhone 16 models.

### What storage size should I buy for my iPhone?

It wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more.

Maurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. "Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people," Klaehne adds.

### Should I trade in my old iPhone?

Trading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not.

### Do I really need an iPhone case?

While an iPhone case is not a necessity -- your iPhone will still function normally without it -- having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the [best cases](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-15-case/) are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked.

### Which iPhone should I buy for a parent?

At the time of writing, the iPhone 13 is the best phone to buy for a parent. While it's not as glass-heavy or flashy as the newer iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro models, the iPhone 13 remains a formidable choice due to its durability, long battery life, and SIM card support. This latter feature is particularly important if your parent travels overseas or prefers the simplicity of swapping a physical SIM card to transfer contacts and data.

The cameras on the iPhone 13 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets.

### What is eSIM?

Embedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14 and 15 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives. 

**Also: [eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/esim-vs-sim-whats-the-difference/)**

There is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief [Jason Hiner](https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/jason-hiner/) sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. "There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable," said Hiner. 

Note that if you buy an iPhone 14 or 15 anywhere outside of the US, the device will come with a regular SIM card slot. 

### Which iPhone models support 5G?

All models within the iPhone 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support [5G wireless technology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-5g-the-business-guide-to-next-generation-wireless-technology/). Even the new iPhone SE (2022) supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks.

5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models.

Even more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?

All of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology. Wireless charging is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers.

Meanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. 

**Also: [Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/)**

MagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands. 

While the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts.

### How many years do iPhones typically last?

While this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years. 

Then, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage. 

If you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an [external hard drive](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-external-hard-drive/) for safekeeping. As a last resort, [a factory reset](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-factory-reset-your-iphone/), followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel.
