## What Is a Desktop PC?

 A desktop PC is a computer that's designed to stay in one place. Desktops usually require an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

 Before you buy a new desktop computer, it's essential to understand how factors such as the[CPU](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150) and[RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) affect system performance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Your Needs and Budget

 Your specific use case determines ideal computer specifications. For example,[the necessary speed of your PC](https://www.lifewire.com/how-fast-does-your-pc-need-to-be-832310) depends on what you plan to do with it. A fast processor, sufficient RAM, and a powerful graphics card are some of the[essentials for a gaming PC](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-consider-before-buying-a-gaming-pc-5221042) . A lower-tier budget desktop should suffice if you plan to use your computer for web browsing and simple productivity tasks like word processing.

| **Price Range** | **What You Can Expect**                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Less than $200  | Capable of surfing the web, checking email, video chatting, streaming video, and that's about it. |
| $250-$1,000     | Fine for surfing the web, running productivity software, and playing simple games.                |
| $1,000-$2,000   | Powerful enough for video editing software, live streaming, and most commercial software.         |
| $2,000+         | Can run graphics-intensive gaming and data processing programs that require a lot of resources.   |

## Desktop Processors

 While there are many different desktop processors or CPUs, most come from just two manufacturers: AMD and Intel. Intel processors generally offer better performance but are more expensive than AMD processors. However, the main difference between processors relates to the[number of cores](https://www.lifewire.com/multiple-core-processors-832453) they offer and their relative speed.

 Most manufacturers present a performance rating system for their desktop PCs, but[comparing across brands isn't always easy](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-compare-processors-5181099) . Your best bet is to look for PCs in your price range and then research the processors to ensure they are powerful enough for your needs.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Memory

 Memory, or RAM, plays a significant role in the speed and performance of a PC. The higher the RAM, the better the performance. Experts recommend at least 8 gigabytes of memory, but 16 GB offers better performance. For gaming and other power-computing uses, 16 GB is the minimum you should consider.

 Although[DDR3 and DDR4 memory](https://www.lifewire.com/types-of-ram-4150713) were the standards for desktop computers for many years, DDR5 is now preferred. When buying memory, try to buy as few DIMMs as possible to allow for future[memory upgrades](https://www.lifewire.com/desktop-memory-buyers-guide-832307) .

 Dual in-line memory modules contain one or several RAM chips on a small circuit board with pins that connect it to the motherboard.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Hard Drives

 While some desktop computers still rely on[hard disk drives](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) , most newer PCs ship with[solid-state drives](https://www.lifewire.com/solid-state-drive-833448) for storing and caching data. SSDs are preferable since[they're faster, more efficient, and more durable than HDDs](https://www.lifewire.com/hdd-vs-ssd-storage-4777761) .

 There are two main elements to consider when[shopping for hard drives](https://www.lifewire.com/best-sata-hard-drives-833475) : size and speed. A modern desktop hard drive should have at least 1TB of storage space. Most traditional HDDs run at 7200 RPM in terms of speed, but some green or variable-speed drives consume less energy (SSDs don't have an RPM number to consider because there are no moving parts). Most motherboards now support[RAID](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-raid-10-2260274) to install several hard drives on your machine.

 RAID stands for_Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives_ or Disks. RAID solutions create more storage at a lower cost.

## Optical Drives (CD/DVD/Blu-Ray)

 Some desktops still come equipped with a DVD burner, but most, especially small form factor PCs, are[doing away with optical drives](https://www.lifewire.com/death-of-the-computer-optical-drive-832403) . Your desktop needs a[Blu-ray](https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-blu-ray-drives-832423) drive to watch new movies in HD. If the computer you want doesn't have optical drives, purchase an external CD, DVD, and Blu-ray player.

## Video and Graphics Cards

 If you don't play PC games with 3D graphics, you don't have to worry about a[dedicated graphics card](https://www.lifewire.com/video-card-buyers-guide-834086) . Gamers should consider a DirectX 12 card with at least 8 GB of onboard memory. Pick a budget video card if you're interested in accelerating non-3D tasks. Factors to consider include performance, the amount of memory on the card, the output connectors, and the version of Direct X supported.

![RTX 4080 Super graphics card.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6UESxNy61q18qGNIRb_NCLm10hE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/rtx408011-03841e3976b8444bb1df0b71e90ea3a5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## External Peripheral Connectors

 Check how many and what type of external ports are available on the computer for use with future peripherals. There are a variety of high-speed peripheral connectors now available. It is best to get a PC with at least six USB ports but there are also[USB hubs](https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-hubs-4142295) available if your dream computer doesn't have enough ports. Other higher-speed connectors include[eSATA](https://www.lifewire.com/external-sata-esata-833450) and[Thunderbolt](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713) , which can be especially useful for external storage. Many desktops also have SD card readers.

## Desktop Monitors

 While there are[all-in-one PCs](https://www.lifewire.com/all-in-one-pcs-832299) with built-in monitors, you still need to consider the quality of the screen. Most monitors today are based on LCD technology, and the only significant difference between them is size and cost. Some other factors, such as color accuracy, may be vital if you plan to use the desktop for graphics work. 24-inch LCDs are the most common, thanks to their affordability and support for full 1080p high-definition video. Larger screens, such as[27-inch LCDs](https://www.lifewire.com/best-27-inch-lcd-monitor-833061) and[4K displays](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-pc-displays-833035) , are also dropping in price.

[How to Choose a Computer Monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/choosing-a-computer-monitor-5204228)

## Artificial Intelligence

 Increasingly, computers of all kinds include some version of AI. Whether we're talking about virtual assistants or fully integrated[large language models](https://www.lifewire.com/large-language-model-7724669) , your new desktop computer will have some functionality of this kind.

 New hardware that runs Windows will have Copilot+, an AI suite that replaces its virtual assistant Cortana. Copilot+ includes features like live captioning of videos and Recall, an option that lets you quickly return to previous tasks.

 Microsoft's first push of Copilot+ targeted laptops, both its own and ones by manufacturers like Asus, Dell, HP, and Samsung, but you may also spot it in desktop models, too.

 Apple announced its own AI system,[Apple Intelligence](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-gpt-7571221) , at WWDC 2024\. This platform brings ChatGPT functionality to the existing assistant, Siri. It will appear on all Apple products, including Macs. The company claims that while Apple Intelligence will capture your activity and process it on-device to optimize tasks, it won't collect or store it to further train the model. If you're privacy-minded, this may be the better option for you.

 Whatever option you go with, you can expect to see some kind of AI in your desktop computer. Microsoft, Apple, and even Samsung have pushed the technology and integrated it into their own and other companies' products, so be sure to look up the following if you have concerns:

* Can you opt in or out? Apple says that you'll have to actively turn Apple Intelligence on to use it, and Microsoft has made the Recall feature optional in Copilot+ computers. If you aren't interested in AI at all, don't get a PC that won't let you turn it off.
* Does it store your data? ChatGPT and other chatbots learn from the interactions they have with users, which means you absolutely shouldn't entrust them with sensitive information. Apple says all of your data will stay on your device. Microsoft stores data (encrypted) to help apps work together but also says it won't use it to train the LLM.

## Who Should Buy a Desktop PC?

 Buying a desktop PC is a good idea if you want a household computer for the whole family to use. Desktops are more versatile than laptops since they have more ports for different types of monitors, keyboards, and other accessories. If you're a graphic designer or visual artist, you'll want a desktop with one or more large monitors.

 When it comes to gaming, desktop PCs are more powerful than most laptops and even dedicated video game consoles. If you like VR games or online games with 3D graphics, you need a desktop and a comfortable gaming chair.

## What to Do After You Buy a Desktop PC

 Once you've connected all the peripherals and booted up your PC for the first time, take steps to[secure your PC](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-safety-tips-153314) from outside attacks before you connect to the internet. Connect your desktop directly to your modem for a more reliable signal. If your desktop comes with a warranty, you may need to register it.

## More Tips

 Although you may be tempted to buy the cheapest desktop PC you can find, it's better to spend money on a device that's slightly more powerful than you need than one that's slightly less powerful than what you need. Just keep in mind that you'll also have to buy a lot of accessories unless you get an all-in-one desktop or you have existing hardware that will work with your new computer.
