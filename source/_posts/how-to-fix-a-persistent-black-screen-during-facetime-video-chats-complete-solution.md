## How to Fix FaceTime Black Screen Issues

 Most fixes for a black screen on FaceTime are things you can do at home. With a bit of time and patience, you should be able to get your calls up and running again. Here are some fixes that have worked for us:

1. Check to see which camera is selected. You might have the rear camera enabled instead of the selfie camera.
2. Check that another app isn't using your device's camera. If one is,[close that app](https://www.lifewire.com/quit-apps-on-iphone-2000287) to remove the black screen on FaceTime.
3. Make sure the camera lens isn't blocked. Check that neither you nor your caller are accidentally covering the camera lens with a finger or thumb. Sometimes, a simple misplaced digit can put the device's camera out of action, leaving you with a black screen.
4. Is this an audio-only call? Check that you haven't accidentally chosen FaceTime Audio. When you call using just audio, you see a **FaceTime**  button in the middle of the screen when speaking. Select this button to switch to a video call.
5. [Restart your iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288) or[restart your iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-ipad-1999820) . Yes, this is another simple option, but it sometimes works, given that rebooting closes all open apps. It might be what's needed to get FaceTime working correctly again.
6. [Check your internet connection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) . One possible reason your FaceTime video isn't working is that your internet is experiencing a problem or isn't particularly strong. If you use a Wi-Fi network, ensure you're as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible.
7. [Check your Screen Time settings](https://www.lifewire.com/using-iphone-content-restrictions-2000102) to make sure FaceTime isn't being restricted. Both you and the caller should confirm this via**Settings** \>**Screen Time**  (iOS 12 or later) or**Settings** \>**General** \>**Restrictions**  (iOS 11 or older).
8. Update your device. Updates can resolve underlying software issues that may cause a FaceTime black screen.  
 This works differently across platforms: macOS \[[Update a MacBook](https://www.lifewire.com/update-macos-macbook-pro-4178508) \] or iOS \[[Update an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-iphones-operating-system-2000293) \].
9. If you still experience issues, factory reset your device. This will restore the whole OS to the way it was when you first purchased the device, deleting all your apps and files along the way.  
 Resetting has the same effect on every platform, but the steps to do it differ slightly: iPhone \[[Reset an iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-iphone-2000277) \], iPad \[[Reset an iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-your-ipad-1994506) \], and Mac \[[Reset a MacBook](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-macbook-macbook-pro-4176259) \].
10. [Make an Apple Store appointment](https://www.lifewire.com/make-apple-store-appointment-with-app-1999600) or go to an authorized repair shop. You should only need to do this if_all_ your video apps display a black screen because that could indicate a hardware problem.
