## Discover the Leading iPhone Email Solutions - We've Rated Them
_If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation._

 When the iPhone debuted in 2007, Apple included a built-in email app called Mail. No third-party mail apps were available at first, but email on the iPhone has come a long way since then.

 The App Store is awash in alternative email applications, so now the challenge is to find the best email app for your iPhone needs.

 Check out this list to find the best email app for your iPhone.

## [The Official App: ​iOS Mail](https://apps.apple.com/app/mail/id1108187098)

![Apple's iOS Mail app for iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lVYsKY-LwCR4wg70s3I1GyET3Os=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003-best-iphone-email-apps-41351461-6c60d24292844b4696e3b264a8194a7d.jpg)

 What We Like

* Comes bundled in iOS and is updated regularly.
* Syncs automatically to Calendar.
* Beginner-friendly but sufficient for most users.
* Integrates with multiple email providers.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks customization and advanced options.

 Apple's free iOS Mail app is a reliable, solid email app for the iPhone. The Mail app offers simple solutions that are good for most needs.

 You can sort out VIP senders (which you define) and file emails to folders. Compose your emails using rich text and swipe to take action fast. Most importantly, you get beautifully rendered emails without clutter and almost no learning curve.

 While iOS Mail lacks advanced customization, it supports Exchange, IMAP, and POP.

## [Long-Running Apple Editors' Choice: ​Spark Mail](https://sparkmailapp.com/)

![Spark Mail iOS app for iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nY7_jnFmAnyciEuyx5JM6bp1tBE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002-best-iphone-email-apps-41351461-e60e6c18c38647f7b4d07c9a43127056.jpg)

 What We Like

* Connect many types of email accounts.
* Supports dark mode.
* Smart notifications.
* Customizable actions.

 What We Don't Like

* Some advanced features require a subscription.
* No read receipts.

 The designation "Editors' Choice" designation by Apple tells a lot about the Spark Mail app, which offers numerous useful features. When you first open Spark, you are presented with an inbox grouped automatically by category.

 You get one-tap replies, swiping actions (including an option to snooze email), and fast search results, which you can save as smart folders. Calendar integration lets you view your schedule and set up events from emails. The customizable actions and push notifications for every email account are superior.

 Spark supports IMAP and is available as a free download, while premium packages are available for enterprise environments. These capabilities, along with email signature options, make Spark worth a try.

## [Manage Multiple Email Accounts: Microsoft Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-outlook-4164620)

![Microsoft Office Email app for iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QrzKeV3orVMMyCjjAcUGdVIIDHE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4135146-1-02720b11b5f74db38b6966b9f2c4cbb6.jpg)

 What We Like

* Feature-rich app.
* Strong community for support.
* Frequent updates.
* Familiar interface.

 What We Don't Like

* Search results are too broad to be useful.
* Not as user-friendly as the desktop Outlook.
* Requires a Microsoft 365 subscription.

 While many email apps for iPhone feel sluggish even with the basics, Outlook for iOS progresses beyond them. Search with near-instant results and read, send, and file mail fast. The intelligent inbox lets you see the most important emails first, and you can[postpone emails](https://www.lifewire.com/postpone-email-outlook-ios-1170626) with a simple swipe.

 This app comes with a calendar, which is simple and functional but lacks task management. As on the desktop version, you can extend functionality with add-ons.

 Outlook for iOS is the best email app for iPhone in an enterprise environment. It supports Exchange and IMAP accounts, although POP isn't supported, and works with Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and iCloud in addition to Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft 365, and Outlook.com. It requires a Microsoft 365 subscription.

## [Best for Professional Use: Polymail](https://polymail.io/)

![Polymail app for iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a5R6mjxPSU5OgQJuFqj0s1OvZag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004-best-iphone-email-apps-41351461-04bee301cd2448eabe2935378a66b282.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* One-tap unsubscribe feature.
* Customizable swipe actions.
* Schedule when emails are read and sent.

 What We Don't Like

* Paid subscription after free trial for most features.
* Doesn't work with password management tools.
* Exchange isn't supported.

 ​Polymail comes in several pricing tiers and with a host of traits geared toward professionals. Notable features include email and attachment tracking to scheduling delivery and message templates.

 No matter the account, Polymail lets you postpone emails for later reading. Like a few other often-used functions, you can access this feature from a swipe menu of customizable actions.

 If you're particular about inbox organization, the Polymail inbox is strictly a plain list of emails sorted by date. Though you can filter it to show only unread emails, it never organizes or groups itself. And while Polymail supports IMAP, it lacks Exchange account support.

## [Stay Organized With Labels and Lists: Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/)

![Airmail for iOS promotional images](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-7vpXG_f-qyM9bBjHL8J-u_VVDE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ScreenShot2019-01-21at2.35.04PM-5c465d5ec9e77c00015d1733.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Sync across multiple devices.
* Easy to configure interface.
* Helpful technical support.

 What We Don't Like

* Email searches are clunky and inaccurate.
* Requires a paid subscription.
* Unclear privacy policy.

 Airmail does everything, it seems, and then some. When it comes to organization and productivity, you can organize folders by labels, turn emails into to-do items, add them to the calendar, and schedule email delivery using Exchange, IMAP, POP, and Gmail.

 This app also offers control over managing contacts and email customization. Choose to block senders, undo emails you've sent, snooze emails, or lock your email. Airmail also offers an easy way to send attachments from cloud storage and displays an email's complete source code.

 While Airmail includes a smart, filtered inbox, its implementation isn't the most elegant. Search is unstructured and not that smart, and Airmail could help more with smart email templates or text snippets.

## [Old and Trusty: Yahoo Mail](https://overview.mail.yahoo.com/)

![Yahoo Mail app for iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VLwYYADAaT1XerZdNmA97667ph4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005-best-iphone-email-apps-41351461-1933fdae3a54460db760cf2fdf72878a.jpg)

 What We Like

* Works with different email accounts.
* Interface is easy to customize.
* Coupon feature with easy access to savings.

 What We Don't Like

* Security issues in the past.
* Pay for premium features.

 Yahoo Mail is for Yahoo Mail accounts and a few others, including Gmail and Outlook Online.

 The Yahoo Mail app for iPhone has a friendly, simple interface. Without confusing you with many options and actions, Yahoo Mail lets you star mail to highlight it, file it in folders, search fast, and filter your inbox by a handful of useful categories (including people, social updates, and important travel emails).

 For sending email, Yahoo Mail shines with impressive image sending and attachment support as well as its unique and colorful email stationery. This app does require paying for some of the premium features.

## [Fast Search and Filters: Edison Mail](https://mail.edison.tech/)

![Three screens from Edison for iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gBs7_sgQ9fFT8pIc1uGcEEgnhp4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_best-iphone-email-apps-4135146-5c465d10c9e77c0001bd9ab1.jpg)

 What We Like

* Easy unsubscribe feature for email.
* Responsive in syncing.
* Can mark emails as spam and block senders.
* Simple user interface.

 What We Don't Like

* Occasional connection issues.
* Collects some user data.

 ​The Edison Mail app is a fantastic email program that gets the important things right, including support for Exchange and IMAP.

 While it isn't the digital assistant it claims to be, it does suggest recipients based on frequency and can filter and use emails by type: bills, booking, shipment notifications, as well as email subscriptions.

 This app lets you find all messages fast (search is speedy and useful), delete the whole bunch in an instant, and unsubscribe with a single tap. When you read newsletters and marketing emails, you can block read receipts.

 To save emails to read later, Edison Mail offers convenient snoozing, and when you tap Send too fast, the app lets you undo it.
