 "[Gorgeous, zippy, and worth the upgrade](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-review-7975801) ," raves our in-house smartphone reviewer, a die-hard Android fan. If even_she_ is salivating over the iPhone 15 Pro, you know it's a phone to seriously consider purchasing, regardless of price.

 With the new USB-C port, Ceramic Shield coating, and lightweight titanium body, this iPhone is one of the best-designed versions Apple has produced in a long time. If you've ever thought about getting a new iPhone, this is the time to spring for one.

 The trio of cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro include a 48MP primary camera, an ultra-wide lens, and a 3X zoom lens. They're a photographer's dream, but even if that's not your thing, the A17 Pro chip makes this phone a standout.

 Apple calls it the fastest chip ever on any smartphone, and it could be right. It's built with a new manufacturing technique that offers increased efficiency and much better performance.  

 The bottom line: If you're in the market for a new smartphone, the iPhone 15 Pro is a high-performing beauty that will last a long time. Apple is even offering a payment plan, so why not make the move now?

## Best Way to Watch the Night Skies: Vespera

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

![A couple viewing the night skies with a tablet and a Vespera. ](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AeGX5e7QVw5_X6x-k76ztxRtb9w=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Vespera-116078ae577341d28af88715dbaef4dc.jpg)

 Billed as the world's lightest observation station, fans of the night sky will love Vespera.

 This portable telescope includes a Sony CMOS built-in sensor and a 50mm quadruplet lens made with lanthanum glass to make photographing deep sky objects near effortless for anyone.

 Here's how it works: Instead of viewing the dark skies through an eyepiece on a telescope, the eyepiece is substituted with a mobile application that lets Vespera send what it sees to your phone using GPS, star pattern recognition, and astrometry to calibrate itself.

 Yes, it's spelled right!_Astrometry_ is a branch of astronomy that uses precise measurements of the stars (where they are and how they move) to plot and understand what's happening in the night skies over Earth.

 Then, you view the skies on your smartphone (or another mobile device) instead of through a telescope.

 It's light (less than 11 pounds) and folds into a small bundle that can easily drop into a backpack or large bag.

 See something you like? Snap a pic with the phone and watch for the next celestial moment that captures your imagination or curiosity.

 Going to the hills? The desert? The backyard? Grab your smartphone and the Vespera, and head out to capture the stars tonight! We'll be right behind you (to sneak some peeks, too!)
