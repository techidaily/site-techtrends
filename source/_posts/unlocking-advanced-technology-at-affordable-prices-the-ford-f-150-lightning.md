## Unlocking Advanced Technology at Affordable Prices: The Ford F-150 Lightning

There are already four different trim options for the Ford F-150 Lightning, ignoring the Extended Range variants. Still, Ford is preparing to include a fifth trim option, the F-150 Lightning "Flash," in its 2024 model year. The Flash trim will appeal to customers who want a more impressive technological experience without a massive increase in price. Its interior is comparable to Ford's Lariat and Platinum trims, it's expected to offer a 320-mile EPA-estimated range, and it includes BlueCruise 1.2 hands-free driving technology.

 Pricing for the F-150 Lightning Flash will start at around $70,000, which includes the $7,500 tax credit. It's the cheapest 2024 model year F-150 Lightning trim to include the 320-mile extended range battery pack and BlueCruise 1.2 technology (plus a 90-day BlueCruise trial). But this trim is most notable for its large 15.5-inch touchscreen infotainment display, integrated wireless charger, and subwoofer-equipped B&O sound system. All of those upgrades were exclusive to the Lariat and Platinum trims in 2023.

 The Flash trim is also notable for its heat pump, which should reduce the effect of cold weather on its battery. Presumably, the heat pump will also be included in the 2024 model year Lariat and Platinum trims, though this assumption hasn't been confirmed by Ford. All upgraded trim options (XLT, Flash, Lariat, Platinum) will include the Towing Technology package.

 Eagle-eyed electric pickup shoppers may notice an oddity with the Flash's price tag—last year, the fancier Lariat trim started at $70,000! It seems that Ford is simply getting rid of the standard-range Lariat, which had a meager 230-mile EPA range. In the 2024 model year, Ford will sell the Lariat trim for about $77,000 and include the "extended range" 320-mile battery by default. This may seem like an odd decision, but the end result is a $70,000 F-150 Lightning with an extended-range battery and other fun stuff, so it's hard to complain.

 Ford will begin selling the [F-150 Lightning Flash](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/10/03/introducing-the-f-150-lightning-flash--a-new-tech-forward-model-.html) in early 2024\. Pricing for this trim will float around $70,000—about $20,000 more than the standard range F-150 Lightning Pro but $27,000 less than the Platinum trim.
