 Microsoft regularly releases major updates to its Windows operating systems.

 Formerly, those updates pushed through comprehensive[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) , but more often these days, they're semi-regular and significant updates through[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) .

 In fact, beginning in[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , the service pack, as we know it from previous versions of Windows, is essentially a dead idea. Much like updates on your smartphone, Microsoft is continually adding major features through automatic patching.

## Latest Major Updates to Windows 11

 As of July 2024, the latest major update to [Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) is Windows 11 Version 23H2, referred to as the_Windows 11 2023 Update_ . Updating is automatic through Windows Update.

 This update first became available on October 31, 2023\. You can read more about the individual fixes and improvements on Microsoft's[Windows 11 Release Information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information) page.

## Latest Major Updates to Windows 8

 The last major update for Windows 8 is the confusingly named Windows 8.1 Update.

 If you've already updated to Windows 8.1, the easiest way to update to Windows 8.1 Update is through Windows Update. See instructions for manually installing Windows 8.1 Update in the_Download Windows 8.1 Update_ section of our [Windows 8.1 Update](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-1-update-2626250) piece.

 If you're not already running Windows 8.1, see [How to Update to Windows 8.1](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-to-windows-8-1-2626252) for detailed instructions on applying the Windows 8.1 update. When that's done, update to Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Update.

 Microsoft isn't planning another big update to Windows 8, like a_Windows 8.2_ or_Windows 8.1 Update 2_ . New features, if available, will instead be pushed through updates on[Patch Tuesday](https://www.lifewire.com/patch-tuesday-2625783) .
