 Microsoft regularly releases major updates to its Windows operating systems.

 Formerly, those updates pushed through comprehensive[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) , but more often these days, they're semi-regular and significant updates through[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) .

 In fact, beginning in[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , the service pack, as we know it from previous versions of Windows, is essentially a dead idea. Much like updates on your smartphone, Microsoft is continually adding major features through automatic patching.

## Latest Major Updates to Windows 8

 The last major update for Windows 8 is the confusingly named Windows 8.1 Update.

 If you've already updated to Windows 8.1, the easiest way to update to Windows 8.1 Update is through Windows Update. See instructions for manually installing Windows 8.1 Update in the_Download Windows 8.1 Update_ section of our [Windows 8.1 Update](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-1-update-2626250) piece.

 If you're not already running Windows 8.1, see [How to Update to Windows 8.1](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-to-windows-8-1-2626252) for detailed instructions on applying the Windows 8.1 update. When that's done, update to Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Update.

 Microsoft isn't planning another big update to Windows 8, like a_Windows 8.2_ or_Windows 8.1 Update 2_ . New features, if available, will instead be pushed through updates on[Patch Tuesday](https://www.lifewire.com/patch-tuesday-2625783) .
