## Exploring the Mighty Ugreen Nexode Pro Amoeba Slim Tower, an Ultra-Powerful Yet Tiny Marvel Reviewed

### Key Takeaways

* The Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W Wall Charger is a space-saving peripheral that offers excellent fast charging capabilities and built-in temperature controls.
* The charger has a minimalist design, with foldable prongs and a matte gray casing that takes up little space when plugged into an outlet.
* While the charger performs well overall, it may emit a high-pitched chirping sound when charging certain devices.

 The [Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim](https://www.amazon.com/stores/UGREEN/NexodeGaNCharger/page/E2DC1280-6B93-4DF5-8AB7-764338BFD173?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-pro-65w-ultra-slim-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a space-saving, grab-and-go peripheral with excellent charging capabilities and a couple of failsafe defenses. While I encountered a few oddities when testing the device, I would still recommend it to folks who aren’t too bothered by the possibilities of high-pitched sounds.

 Ugreen has let us know that there was a production delay with the Nexode Pro 65W Slim. The charger should be available for purchase by the end of June or early July 2024.

 The unit reviewed here was preproduction and the chirping or buzzing sounds may be attributable to that.

##  Design: King of the Unobtrusive

 I’ve tested several Ugreen products over the last few months, and I’ve always been a fan of the way the company's [wall chargers](https://article-files.techidaily.com/all-encompassing-virtual-horizon-review/) and power banks look and feel. The Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim (model X753) is no exception here. Scoring big in the minimalist department, the device is just 2 inches wide, 3.25 inches tall, and a little under 0.75 inches from front to back.

 The matte gray casing seen on many Ugreen products returns here, along with the usual black trimming where the USB ports are located. From left to right, there’s a USB-A port, followed by two USB-C connections. The wall plug portion is located on the back of the [charger](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and I like that Ugreen decided to make the prongs foldable.

 When plugged into an outlet, the Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim takes up very little space and can be connected up or down, depending on what you’ve got plugged in above or below it.

##  Features: Gallium Nitride Returns

 The Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim is outfitted with several Ugreen staples, including the company’s patented GaNInfinity technology and Thermal Guard protection. The former feature is Ugreen’s take on GaN engineering, which ditches traditional silicone conductors for a crystalline material. Beyond the fanciful science-speak, the result is less heat dispersion, which allows companies like Ugreen to build smaller chargers that dissipate heat more efficiently.

 As for the Thermal Guard protection, this is Ugreen’s take on temperature monitoring. If the Nexode Pro 65W gets too warm, the charger should be disabled. While testing the product, I never had an issue with heat, so I’m guessing this failsafe never needed to be activated.

##  Charging: Is There a Cricket in Here?

 The Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim is a little beast when it comes to [charging devices.](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/freedom-in-viewing-is-vlc-more-powerful-than-mpc-for-2024/) Over the several days, I tested the device, I put it through a number of refueling trials with my late 2020 MacBook Pro, iPhone 12, and AirPods Pro 2\. I also used the unit to charge up a Ugreen 20,000mAh 100W power bank and a Mophie charger with the same battery capacity.

 As for charging configurations, the amount of wattage dispersed will depend on how many ports are in use. With just one device plugged in, the USB-A maxes out at 22.5W, the first USB-C at 30W, and the second USB-C at 65W. This latter USB-C port is best used for charging up hardware like tablets, laptops, or power banks. In one test, I was able to charge a Ugreen 20,000mAh power bank from 54 percent battery to 85 percent in just half an hour!

 When charging via USB-A and the first USB-C, both ports top out at 15W. If you use USB-A and the far-right USB-C, the former is capped at 18W and the latter tops out at 45W. With both USB-C ports in use, the left output is capped at 20W and the right at 45W.

 At one point, I was using the charger to fuel my iPhone 12 and my girlfriend’s phone (same model), using both USB-C connections and a pair of AirPods using the USB-A port. With all three connections in use, both USB-A and the first USB-C are capped at 15W, while the fast-charge USB-C maxes out at 45W.

 Because the Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim is missing a ground prong, I thought it had a loose fit with most of the outlets I plugged it into. It was never to the point where I was afraid it was going to fall out, but an accidental kick to the charger could easily dislodge it from a proper wall connection.

 Overall, I thought the device did an excellent job of charging all my test components without running too warm, but I can’t say the same for my power bank test. When charging the Ugreen and Mophie chargers, both the Nexode Pro 65W and the power banks became especially toasty. But what was more concerning was a high-pitched chirping noise emitted by the charger.

 I was charging both devices via USB-C, and no matter what port I chose or what outlet it was connected to, I couldn’t get the sound to stop. What’s even weirder is this issue didn't happen all the time. But when it was chirping hour, the noise never ceased.

##  Should You Buy the Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W Wall Charger?

 The [Ugreen Nexode Pro 65W Ultra-Slim](https://www.amazon.com/stores/UGREEN/NexodeGaNCharger/page/E2DC1280-6B93-4DF5-8AB7-764338BFD173?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fugreen-nexode-pro-65w-ultra-slim-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) is a convenient fuel station that doesn’t take up much space and delivers a fast and powerful charging experience. I think it’s great at refueling multiple devices at once, and I thought the 65W USB-C did an excellent job at adding more battery to my external power banks.

 That being said, I’d err on the side of caution when using that 65W USB-C port. Considering its Thermal Guard protection and GaN build, I assume the high-pitched chirping isn't a big deal, but you can never be sure.

_This product will be available at the links in January 2024._
