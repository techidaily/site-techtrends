ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced its partnership with [the National Forest Foundation](https://www.nationalforests.org/) (NFF). As part of ABBYY’s Go Green campaign to reduce paper waste through its optical character recognition (OCR) technology, ABBYY’s North America headquarters will donate to the NFF’s Trees for US program for every trial download of ABBYY FineReader 12 — with the goal of planting 20,000 trees through the life of the partnership. With ABBYY’s contribution, the NFF will work to restore the Chippewa National Forest in North Central Minnesota. This forest suffered from a devastating wind event in 2012 that left many acres in need of reforestation.

“America’s National Forests and Grasslands play a critical role in the overall health of the environment and our communiies, as they produce the clean air and water that citizens and wildlife need,” said Wes Swaffar, Senior Manager, Ecosystem Services, National Forest Foundation. “Through partnerships with forward-thinking companies like ABBYY, the NFF is revitalizing America’s forests and improving the future for generations of Americans.”

Restoring the nation’s forests is critical to preserving America’s wildlife ecosystem while combating the key causes of global climate change. Healthy forests produce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air, as well as prevent pollutants and sediment from entering our waterways.

In one year, an acre of mature trees absorbs the amount of carbon dioxide produced by driving a car 26,000 miles — the distance it takes to drive from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. ten times. Reducing our reliance on paper products is a key first step in preventing further deforestation.

For the past 25 years, ABBYY has been a leader in reducing paper use through its technology. ABBYY’s FineReader 12 solution is designed to limit the use of paper by allowing users to digitize paper documents and photos into editable, searchable electronic formats that are easily distributed, shared and stored. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the average office worker today uses a staggering 10,000 pieces of paper in a year. In addition to promoting the importance of going paperless, ABBYY will help the NFF plant native trees on our National Forests for each trial download of ABBYY FineReader 12.

“ABBYY supports and shares the National Forest Foundation’s goal of healthy forests and grasslands,” said Dean Tang, CEO of ABBYY NAHQ. “We look forward to a long-lasting partnership with the National Forest Foundation as their commitment aligns with ABBYY’s vision to digitize paper documents to move toward a paperless environment.”
