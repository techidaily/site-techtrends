4. **[Bonus tip: Update your device drivers via Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Disable the Windows Update Service

 Method 2 is pretty much self-explanatory. By**disabling the Windows Update Service** , Windows will stop checking for updates, hence sparing you the wanted Windows updates. To do so:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**   and **R**   at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**   into the box and click **OK** .

### Method 2: **Meter your Wifi network**

 If you’re using Wifi network, then method 2 will just do the trick. By**metering your Wi-fi network** , Windows will automatically take it that you’re on a limited data plan (even if you aren’t) and stop forcing Windows updates on your computer. Here’s how:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** , type**wifi** and click**Change Wi-Fi settings** .

 4) Hopefully it solves your woes and you won’t see another ‘unsolicited’ Windows update on your computer.

## **Method 3: Change Group Policy Settings**

 Note that Method 3 works in **Windows Pro** , **Enterprise** , and**Professional** EXCEPT **Windows Home** as it doesn’t have group policy.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key and**   **R**  at the same time, then t ype  **gpedit.msc**  into the box and click  **OK** .

 It’s recommendable to select**Enabled** and**Notify for downloads and auto install** (see below) so that you can always get a confirmation message instead of an auto update (meanwhile still keeping a watchful eye for an important Windows update). Also, you might need to select**Enabled** if you are to upgrade your Windows to a higher version.
