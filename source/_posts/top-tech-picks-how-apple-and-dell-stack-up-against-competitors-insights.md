### Best laptop computer

**Apple MacBook Air M2 t** **ech specs:** **OS:** macOS 13.0 Ventura | **CPU:** Apple M2 chip with 8-core CPU | **GPU:** 8-core or 10-core GPU | **RAM:** 8GB, 16GB or 24GB | **Storage:** 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | **Screen:** 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display with 500 nits brightness and True Tone technology | **Ports and slots:** MagSafe 3 charging port, 3.5mm headphone jack, 2 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports | **Camera:** 1080p FaceTime HD camera | **Battery:** 15-18 hours | **Dimensions:** 11.97 x 8.46 x .44 inches | **Weight:** 2.7lbs | **Price:** Starting at$1,199

As far as laptops go, there's arguably nothing more powerful on the market right now than Apple's M2 chip, which you'll see in the 2022 MacBook Air. The 2022 MacBook Pro also has this processor, but the MacBook Air is less expensive, lighter, and slimmer than the Pro.

While the MacBook Air was once known as Apple's most basic laptop, this 2022 model sets it on the same playing field as the Pro, making it a powerhouse laptop that can do everything from streaming your favorite show to video editing.

**Review: [Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022) review: Sleeker, faster -- and more expensive](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review/)**

ZDNET writer Cliff Joseph went hands-on with the M2 MacBook Air, and said it "throws down the gauntlet to its Windows-based rivals."

"The 10-core GPU of our review unit proved much faster than the 7-core GPU of the M1 MacBook Air, breezing ahead from 18,620 to 30,200 -- an improvement of just over 60%," he said. 

In addition, the magnetic MagSafe connector's return and a new quad-driver stereo speaker system that makes video calls, presentations, and streaming sound impressive are standout features. Other notable specs: 500 nits of brightness on the display, the option for more RAM, and all-day battery life.

## M1 iMac 24-inch

### Best Mac computer

**M1 iMac 24-inc** **h t** **ech specs: OS:** MacOS (Monterey)| **CPU:** M1 or 10th Gen. Intel Core i5 | **GPU:** 7-core GPU or AMD Radeon Pro 5300 | **RAM:** 8GB or up to 128GB | **Storage:** 256GB or 512GB | **Screen:** 24-inch 4.5K Retina display, 4480-by-2520 resolution, 500 nits | **Wireless:** Bluetooth 5.0, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) | **Ports and slots**: 2 Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, 2 USB 3 Ports | **Camera:** 1080p FaceTime HD camera **| Audio**: Six-speaker system with wide stereo sound and spatial audio support, 3.5mm headphone jack | **Dimensions:** 54.7 x 14.7 x 46.1cm (21.5 x 5.8 x 18.1in.) | **Weight:** 4.46kg/9.83lbs | **Price:** $1,299 (8-Core CPU, 7-Core GPU), $1,499 (8-Core CPU, 8-Core GPU), $1,699 (8-Core CPU, 8-Core GPU, and 512GB SSD)

Apple users looking for something bigger than a MacBook should consider the high-end 24-inch iMac. This computer comes with the latest version of the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Mouse 2\. If your work means lots of Zoom meetings, you'll be thankful for the FaceTime HD camera, the 4.5K Retina display, and the six-speaker sound system that supports spatial audio. 

Of course, the M1 chip CPU makes it extremely fast and efficient -- you won't notice any slowing down if you have 30 browser tabs open. And, to relive the nostalgia of early 2000s Apple computers, the iMac comes in blue, green, pink, silver, yellow, orange, and purple.

**Review:** [**Apple iMac 24-inch (M1, 2021): Slim, power-efficient, and colorful**](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-imac-with-4-5k-retina-display-all-in-one-m1-8-gb-ssd-256-gb-led-24-us-mgpc3lla/)

Joseph also got his hands on the 24-inch iMac and was impressed by its striking, slimline design. 

"The overall effect is that the screen does feel more spacious and easy on the eye when browsing through web pages or opening documents in software such as Word or Excel," he wrote. "But the most remarkable aspect of this new design only becomes evident if you look at it from the sides. The highly integrated design of the M1 SoC has allowed Apple to reduce the size of the iMac's main motherboard and cooling system, so that the screen panel now measures just 11.5mm thick."

## Which computer is right for you?

As you can see from the variety of computers on this list, there are many features to consider before purchasing a computer. If you're looking for something portable to take with you, a laptop is going to work better than a desktop. Everyone has an operating system preference, so if you're a diehard Apple user, stick with Apple, and the same for Windows users, so you're already more familiar from the get-go. 

Look at standout features based on how you will be using your computer. For example, if you'll mainly be using it for gaming, make sure it has good CPU and GPU. If you'll be using your computer for more basic things, great battery life is important to pay attention to, especially when opting for a laptop. Less important specs are cameras and audio since you can always add additional devices to improve upon what your computer already comes with.

## How did I choose these computers?

Since picking and choosing the right computer is a tall task, I looked at our best lists for separate computer categories like laptops, large tablets, gaming PCs, etc., and picked the top product from those lists. I also paid attention to ZDNET staff recommendations and their experiences using these devices. 

To choose the best product from each category, I looked at factors like price, power and speed, display, and more. To see more products in the categories listed above, check out the accompanying best list page at the bottom of every product.

## What is the difference between Windows and Mac operating systems?

The age-old [debate between Windows and Mac](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-mac-or-linux-we-compare-the-pros-and-cons-of-these-computing-platforms/) is a tricky one. When it comes down to operating systems (OS), it's all about preference. Mac OS is great if you already have an iPhone since it integrates all your iCloud data right into your new computer. Macs are also historically known for better privacy and fewer Malware threats than Windows devices. Mac OS is straightforward for the average tech user, making it super popular for people of all ages to become familiar with.

On the other hand, Windows is much better for gamers and lets you choose different hardware options such as touchscreens and independently produced components. Corporate users almost always use Windows over Mac. You'll also find more of the best budget computers with Windows over Apple's pricier products.

However, since so many different brands and makers widely use Windows, there are sometimes inconsistencies with the OS depending on the device you purchase.

## Do you need to have a touchscreen?

Although most of the world is touchscreen-based these days, your computer definitely does not have to have a touchscreen. 

**Also: [The 5 best touchscreen laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-touchscreen-laptop/)**

Of course, a touchscreen is helpful if you're an artist or work a lot with graphics and must draw on a screen, but the average person can forgo the touchscreen feature on a computer.
