The advent of drones are expected to create a whole new wave in the world of photography and changing the way of recording videos in the outdoors. And DJI is absolutely the fresh troop of drones, which had seven of the [best 10 drones assessed by PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/337251/the-best-drones). Thus sometimes it's not so much seeking for a drone video editor as for DJI video editor. As for why you need a video editor for DJI drone footage, you'll deeply understand after you shoot your first video with DJI drones.

A significant fraction of DJI drones are available for 4K UHD videos recording. And a single minute of 4K video at 60fps and a high 100Mbps bit rate recorded by Dji Phantom 4 Advanced requires a whopping 750MB. When you record a slightly longer 4K video, maybe a 10-minute one, the video file size is going to be awfully huge, which bodes ill for drones videos storage on limited capacity and sharing to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo etc. Meanwhile, the crisp and sharp 4K UHD videos at 60fps would be failed to play on lower-end hardware. That is to say, you need a DJI video editor to [reduce and compress drones video file size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and make it playable on various devices. For that, we're going to tell you some finest DJI aerial video editing tools of different skill levels.
