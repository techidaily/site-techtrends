2. DVD Shrink noticed that there is a Navigation error when ripping Sony DVD.
3. My friends used AnyDVD and DVDFab to rip The Pee Mak DVD (a Thai movie) containing a bad sector, but finally failed. Mostly because the variations on bad sector copy protection have not been used on DVDs in the USA or Europe and AnyDVD or DVDFab constantly are updated for Hollywood movies.
