### Best kids' tablet overall

Apple's tried-and-true tablet, the base model iPad, is great for kids. You get all of the same features as the more expensive [iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2022-review/) and [iPad Air](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-ipad-air-fifth-generation-review/) models but in a lightweight form factor with a 10.2-inch display that has [True Tone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208909). 

Although there's a newer iPad model, the 9th generation has pretty much all of the same features and costs less than the 2022 model at $330\. (I don't recommend spending $449 for the newer model for your child to use and abuse unless you plan to share it with them.)

**Review:** **[Apple iPad (9th generation)](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-2021/)**

Early education experts agree that the 9th-gen iPad is kid-friendly and the best option for most people. 

[Troy Portillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-portillo-6136ba190/), director of operations of [Studypool](https://www.studypool.com/), an online learning platform for students, said that if you have younger kids in need of a tablet, you can't go wrong with Apple's iPad: "Your kid doesn't need the more expensive iPad Air or even the iPad Pro."

"You can still get all the great security features that come standard with Apple products and customer support. You can also easily monitor your kid's activity online, limit screen time, and use parental controls for specific apps," he said. 

Parents can control their kids' iPad experience through Apple's Family Sharing feature. This feature lets them limit screen time for specific apps, notifies them if a child is trying to buy an app, and sends reminders for events like family game night, among other things. 

And as a recent Best Buy customer said in their review, "The iPad is so easy to use. The kids love it. There are lots of learning apps and games to play. It's great for in-car entertainment as well." 

_Author's Note: The Apple iPad (9th generation) is currently on sale for $200 (save $130)._

## Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet

### Best kids' tablet with a large display

For bigger kids (ages 6-12), there is Amazon's new Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet. New to this generation is 25% faster speeds, higher quality 5-megapixel cameras, and 13 hours of battery life instead of 12 hours. 

Thanks to the 10.1-inch display, you'll get a larger screen without adding much to the overall cost. The resolution is better than previous generations, with a 1080p Full HD brighter display. It comes with a protective case, a two-year worry-free guarantee, and a year subscription to Amazon Kids+. 

It comes with a slim, kid-proof case and preset age filters for kids ages 6-12\. Even with all these improvements, this model is still $10 less than the previous generation, at $190\. 

**Review:** **[Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-tablet-is-redefining-what-a-kids-tablet-can-do/)**

ZDNET writer Maria Diaz went hands-on with the new Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet and was "pleasantly surprised" by its smooth performance. 

"The Fire HD 10 Kids Pro has proven itself decidedly faster than both generations of the Fire HD 8 Kids tablets we have, and since the older ones were passed down to a four-year-old and a two-year-old, that hasn't been a problem. However, the seven-year-old and new owner of the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro definitely notices the difference," she wrote. 

In a Best Buy review, one customer noted, "Once you have learned how to use Amazon Kids to download apps, it works great. My five-year-old loves it. It's pretty durable considering this has a slimmer case than the old version."

## Samsung Galaxy Tab A8

### Best Samsung kids' tablet

If you'd rather your kid have a proper Android tablet with full Google support, look no further than the Galaxy Tab A8\. 

"This tablet is packed with features that make it the perfect choice for parents looking to keep their children entertained and informed while they are away from home," parenting expert and creator of [Parental Questions](http://www.parentalquestions.com/) Mo Mulla told ZDNET. 

Mulla also speaks highly of Samsung Kids, which parents can access from any Samsung tablet, as it lets parents give their kids access to specific contacts and apps, provides learning challenges for kids to avoid mindless scrolling, and even includes interaction with Samsung-specific animated characters. 

"Its kid-friendly content has been explicitly created with kids in mind and includes educational apps and games to help entertain them and keep them active during playtime," he said. 

While the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 won't blow you away with overall performance, it can run your favorite apps, handle light gaming, and stream movies and shows. In addition, its expandable storage capacity ensures there is never a shortage of space on the device for downloads or extra materials when needed. 

One Best Buy customer noted in their review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 how expensive other tablets can be, especially when considering buying one for kids: "If you don't want to spend $300+ on an iPad for your kiddo, this is definitely the route to go." 

**Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 t** **ech specs: Display**: 10.5 inches | **Resolution:** 1920 x 1200 | **Processor**: Octa Core Unisoc T618 | **Storage**: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, microSD up to 1TB | **Cameras**: 8MP rear, 5MP front camera | **Weight**: 1.12lbs | **Dimensions**: 9.72 x 6.37 x 0.27 inches | **Connections**: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB 2.0 | **Battery life:** 7,040mAh (About 6 hours)

### Best kids tablet for littler kids

While similar to the Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet, the Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is made with little kids in mind. It comes with a colorful kid-proof case built to withstand 3- to 7-year-olds since it protects against drops and bumps, and it comes complete with an adjustable stand so your kids can go hands-free. 

It also comes with a free one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+ and an Amazon FreeTime Unlimited subscription, which grants access to thousands of kid-friendly, ad-free books, movies, games, and other kid-friendly and educational content. 

"The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is a well-built, entry-level tablet that comes with a sturdy kid-proof cover and features useful parental controls," says Diaz, who [bought](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-bought-this-amazon-kids-tablet-instead-of-an-ipad-and-wasnt-sorry/) the tablet for her kids. 

**Review:** **[Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-bought-this-amazon-kids-tablet-instead-of-an-ipad-and-wasnt-sorry/)**

"Its 13-hour battery life means that you'll need to charge it less often than other competitors, and the combination of a durable case and screen ensures the integrity of the Fire tablet for years to come," she says. However, Amazon offers you a two-year worry-free guarantee in case the tablet does succumb to playtime. 

One Amazon customer said they were impressed with the device's durability: "One of the first things that caught my attention is the impressive build quality of the tablet. Designed with kids in mind, the sturdy construction and reinforced edges provide a sense of durability that assures me the device can withstand the inevitable bumps and drops that come with the territory of young users."

_Author's Note: The Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids tablet is on sale for $90 (save $60) on Amazon._

**Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids tech specs: Display:** 8-inch display | **Processor:** Hexa-core 2.0 Ghz | **Storage:** 32GB or 64GB (expandable by up to 1 TB) | **Memory:** 2GB | **Colors:** Blue, purple, Disney Mickey Mouse, or Disney princess **| Cameras:** 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording | **Weight:** 18.3 ounces | **Dimensions:** 8.7 x 7.1 x 1.1 inches| **Connections:** 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | **Battery life:** 13 hours

## Lenovo Tab P11 Plus

### Best kids' tablet for battery life

Lenovo's Tab P11 Plus is an attractive tablet that's not overly expensive. The 11-inch 2K display looks fantastic, and the battery life will keep your child entertained for hours. The battery life is perhaps the best part of this tablet: Lenovo touts up to 15 hours of video streaming, and ZDNET tests can back that claim up. Plus, it runs Android 11 out of the box. 

A Best Buy customer also mentioned in their review that the Lenovo Tablet P11 Plus had surpassed their expectations regarding battery life compared to other tablets. 

One downside to the Tab P11 Plus is that it lacks a headphone jack, so if you want to keep your child's cartoons or games quiet, you'll have to invest in some kid-friendly Bluetooth headphones. 

**Review:** [**Lenovo Tab P11 Plus**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovo-tab-p11-plus-review/)

Moderately priced at $270, the Lenovo Tab P11 Plus is easily recommended and competent. In ZDNET's review, June Wan said, "It's hard to argue against how much value you're getting with this tablet." 

Plus, you'll get kid-friendly features already built into the tablet.

"For parents, the tablet can dial into Android's [Kids Space](https://families.google.com/kidsspace/). When turned on, the Tab P11 Plus switches to a child-friendly interface filled with teacher-approved games, educational videos, and digital content to keep any kid engaged," Wan wrote. "Through the Family Link app, you can monitor, set screen-time limits, and even lock the tablet from your phone."

**Lenovo Tab P11 Plus t** **ech specs: Display**: 11-inch display | **Processor**: MediaTek Helio G90T | **Storage**: 64GB or 128GB | **Memory**: 4GB or 6GB | **Colors**: Slate grey | **Cameras**: 8MP front and 13MP rear | **Weight**: 1.1lbs | **Dimensions**: 10.2 by 6.4 by 0.3 inches | **Connections**: USB-C, microSD | **Battery life:** Up to 15 hours

### Best kids' tablet for reading

While tablets are meant to provide entertainment for your kids, it's not necessarily always the best kind of entertainment. A Kindle Kids e-reader is a great way to compromise on a tablet that stimulates your child's brain. The Kindle Kids e-reader is designed for kids ages 3-12 and comes with an Amazon Kids+ subscription for kid-friendly books and audiobooks. 

You can even keep track of their reading progress with Amazon's Parent Dashboard, adjust book age filters, add books to your kid's library, and set a bedtime for each child's profile. Plus, Kindle Kids comes built-in with Vocabulary Builder and Word Wise to help young readers build their reading skills and tackle more challenging books.

And since kids are unpredictable, this reading tablet comes with a two-year worry-free guarantee. If it breaks, Amazon will replace it for free. 

One Amazon customer shared their child's experience using the Amazon Kindle Kids: "I got this for my 11-year-old son for Christmas. He loves reading, and he's read 11 books in one month! I didn't realize this would be smaller than the standard Kindle, but it is a good size for kids. It has a good selection of books for his age as well."

**Amazon Kindle Kids tech specs: Display:** 300 ppi high-resolution, glare-free display | **Storage**: 16GB | Weight: 9.03 ounces | **Dimensions:** 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.53 inches | **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth | **Battery life:** Up to 6 weeks

## What is the best kids' tablet alternative?

Apple's base iPad is the best kids' tablet that money can buy. It offers the complete package of performance, battery life, app availability, and widespread accessory support. It's a great option for kids who need a reliable device for schoolwork, gaming, or streaming content. However, if you prefer Android OS or a better price point, there are plenty of solid alternatives on the market.

## Which is the right tablet for your kid?

Picking the right kids' tablet comes down to a couple of questions you must ask yourself. First and foremost, you need to have a set budget in mind. Once you decide how much you will spend, you can begin narrowing down your options. Then, determine if you want a tablet made by a specific company. 

| **Choose** **this** **kids' tablet.** | **If you want...**                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Factors to consider when choosing a kids' tablet

Before you invest in a kids' tablet, you'll want to consider the following: 

* **Durability:** Having a tablet that can last is especially important when kids will be using the device. If a tablet isn't durable to bumps and drops (like the iPad), be sure to invest in a kid-proof case.
* **Ease of use:** A tablet for kids needs to be simple. Consider factors such as large screens, built-in apps, and operating systems that are easy for kids to learn.
* **Parental controls:** Your kids' safety and privacy are #1 when it comes to tablets. Look at what kind of parental controls each tablet offers, including features like screen-time monitoring and app restrictions.
* **Cost**: Kids tablets run the gamut in price, so decide on your budget, as well as what you need and what features are most important to you in a tablet.

Tim Dikun, dad and Teaching.com COO and vice president of product, also recommended you "look for granular parental controls, including if specific apps can be blocked and/or unlocked around certain times. For example, Amazon's FreeTime app allows parents total control over how children use the tablet by setting learning goals, limiting time spent on gaming apps, or locking gaming apps until learning goals are met." 

## How did we test these kids' tablets?

ZDNET does hands-on testing for variety of tablets, including tablets for kids. We also take into consideration advice from parents and parenting experts, as well as user reviews. In our tablet testing and research, we consider factors like durability, battery life, user interface, and parental control options. We also write reviews of new tablets we test, and update this list periodically with the latest tablets for kids we recommend.

## What should parents know about tablets and screen time?

Rebecca Mannis, PhD., learning specialist at [Ivy Prep Learning Center](http://www.ivy-prep.com/), referred to The American Academy of Pediatrics' new guidelines, which recommends no consistent screen exposure before 18 months of age, one hour tops of screen exposure for ages 2 through 5, and limiting screen use to two hours after age 5\. 

"In considering preschools and primary schools, it is helpful to know their policies -- both to see how their philosophies match your family values, and so you can reinforce their rules at home," she said. 

Mannis added that while kids often learn to read these days through a tablet, thanks to reading apps, it's essential to switch up how your child reads. 

"Researchers have found that the brain processes content that we read online in a different way - and one that is not as skilled," she said. "So, as great as online reading is, give your kids lots of opportunities to hold books in their hands to maximize their literacy skills growth. Or 'cross train' their reading between devices and traditional print books to see if you as a parent notice a difference."

## Can my kids use YouTube on Amazon's Fire tablets?

Not officially. Amazon customizes the base version of Android and turns it into Fire OS, forgoing any Google certification in order to make Google's apps available on the tablets. 

You won't find the official YouTube app available in the Appstore, but you can use Amazon's Silk browser to access the YouTube website to gain access to the video platform.

## How many GB is enough for a kids' tablet?

Depending on the tablet, you want to ensure you have sufficient storage for downloading or pre-installing kid-friendly content for those long road trips. 

Assuming your child will obsess over taking pictures and videos -- which can easily take up 5-6 GB -- we would recommend a tablet with at least 32 GB of storage. 

## What brand of tablet is best for kids?

Although there's plenty to choose from our list above, the Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro is the most promising. As the 11th generation of the Amazon Fire 10 Kids tablet, its proven to be one of the best evolving kids tablets out there. 

It is faster, higher quality, and has a long battery life. If you can get past Amazon's slightly limited app store, this tablet is sure to keep your child entertained on an airplane or long car ride. 

## Are children's tablets the same as regular tablets?

If you're worried about your child's online safety, nowadays, you can put parental controls on almost any tablet, so there's no free range to downloadable content.

When it comes to everything else, i.e., price, case, warranty, and subscription, it's best to consider a kids' tablet in case something happens. 

Overall, a kids' tablet will provide a safe and engaging environment tailored to your child's needs while a regular tablet will always cater to a wider audience. 

## Are there alternative tablets for kids worth considering?

There are plenty of tablets on the market that can be kid-friendly. Be sure to look for features like parental controls, long battery life, and ease of use. Here are a few other options to consider. 

## What is the average age to get a child a tablet?

Honestly, this depends on your parenting philosophy. For starters, your child will need fine motor skills to handle the tablet and the ability to navigate the device independently. Another factor is exposure to technology. Maybe you would prefer to have your child less dependent on technology for entertainment. Several surveys show no definitive answer as parents are divided on the topic. Regardless, it is best for you as a parent to weigh the pros and cons of introducing your child to technology.
