## How to Fix D3dx9\_28.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not, under any circumstances, download the d3dx9\_28 DLL file individually from any "DLL download site." There are a number of reasons[why downloading DLLs like that is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, remove it from wherever you put it, and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet done so.  
 The d3dx9\_28.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely. It's unlikely this will fix the problem, but restarting is always a good first step.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the d3dx9\_28.dll not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error you're receiving, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or other program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall the game or other program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something may have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_28.dll, and a reinstallation could do the trick.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_28.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above steps haven't worked to solve your error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

 Unlike many other[DLL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) errors which can have complicated causes and fixes, d3dx9\_28.dll issues are caused in one way or another by a single issue: a problem with Microsoft DirectX.

 This file is one of many contained in the DirectX software collection. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows-based games and advanced graphics programs, d3dx9\_28.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

 There are many ways d3dx9\_28.dll errors may show up on your computer. Some of the more common error messages are listed below:

* **D3DX9\_28.DLL Not Found**
* **D3DX9\_28.DLL is missing. Replace D3DX9\_28.DLL and try again.**
* **File d3dx9\_28.dll not found**
* **The file d3dx9\_28.dll is missing**
* **D3dx9\_28.dll not found. Reinstalling might help fix this.**
* **The application could not be started because d3dx9\_28.dll was not found. Reinstalling could remove the problem.**

 These errors typically appear when a software program, usually a game, is started. In other non-game graphics applications, the error might appear before certain advanced graphics features of the program are used.

 Some common games and other applications that have been known to generate d3dx9\_28.dll errors include_Singles 2: Triple Trouble_ , Futuremark's 3DMark06, Digital Leisure eJay Techno 5,_Pacific Storm_ ,_Puzzle Quest_ ,_Breakpoint: Rumble In The Jungle_ , and more.
