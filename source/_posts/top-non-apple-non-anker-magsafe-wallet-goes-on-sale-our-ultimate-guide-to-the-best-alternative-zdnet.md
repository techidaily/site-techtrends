### Best MagSafe wallet overall

Journey's Ezmo MagSafe wallet is the perfect balance of style and function. With enough space to hold five cards (the most on this list), it indeed resembles a classic wallet and not just a cardholder. The Ezmo wallet also doubles as a phone stand, so you can watch your favorite entertainment on the go or keep your phone screen visible at your desk. The stand has adjustable viewing angles in both portrait and landscape modes.

It's made of vegan leather and comes in four traditional color options (black, dark brown, navy blue, and dove gray). The Ezmo MagSafe wallet also features a protective lining with RFID technology to safeguard your cards' information while preventing them from becoming demagnetized.

**Also:** [**The best MagSafe wallet I've tested is not made by Apple or Anker**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-magsafe-wallet-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-apple-or-anker-and-its-on-sale/)

I tested the Ezmo wallet for several weeks in my everyday activities, including my commute from New Jersey to New York City. When evaluating MagSafe wallets, I always look for easy and seamless access to my NJ Transit card, which I need to grab and put away quickly. Thanks to the notch on the front of the Ezmo wallet, I can store my transit card in the front. It's easy to slide out, so I highly recommend choosing one with a front-notch option if you're looking for a commuter-friendly wallet. 

I also like how the Ezmo MagSafe wallet provides enough space for five cards and even folded cash. It's perfect for holding my debit card, work badge, and other incidentals like paper train tickets. I don't often keep my driver's license or credit card in my phone wallet while going to work, but I like that I can do so if I need or want to for another event or activity. 

The phone stand was nice, too. I enjoyed being able to prop my phone up while at the office. I even found myself using the back half of the wallet as a makeshift grip on the train, which added some extra stability. Although it's one of the priciest options on this list, I think it's well worth the investment due to its multi-functionality and excellent quality, especially if you use your MagSafe wallet daily. The Ezmo wallet is also available in a tracking version -- the LOC8 MagSafe Finder Wallet and Stand -- if you're prone to losing things frequently. 

Current users on the Journey website said they liked the slim profile, smart design, larger card capacity, and sleek material -- so much so that the wallet has a 5/5-star rating online, with one customer noting that it "does it all really well."

**Journey Ezmo wallet and phone stand features:** Multi-functional | RFID protection | Built-in lock to prevent card slippage | **Dimensions:** 66 mm x 102.5 mm x 12.5 mm | **Card capacity:** Up to 5 cards

Pros 
* Lightweight
* Versatile
* Still easily fits in a pocket

Cons 
* Comes unattached upon harsh impact
* Can only hold 2 cards comfortably

## Clckr MagSafe phone holder and wallet

### Best MagSafe wallet for durability

The Clckr is the ultimate multitasker wallet and is perfect for the person who loves to run out the door with nothing else in hand. Not only is the Clckr slim and stylish in design and comes in lavender or black, but it securely stores up to two cards. 

When former ZDNET associate editor Christina Darby tested the Clckr, she noted that the cardholder slot kept her cards secure but easy to access when needed. Darby said she wished it could fit just one more card, but she reported that other features compensated for this. 

Coupled with this wallet's practicality is its top-tier multi-functionality. "Without adding any extra bulk, the cardholder has a foldable strip down the middle that, when clicked into place, acts as a kickstand or phone grip. Thanks to the powerful 3500 G magnet, the grip makes it easy to transport my phone, while the kickstand makes for the perfect portable tripod," Darby wrote. 

When you want to remove the Clckr, simply lightly twist and pull, and you'll feel the magnet tug off. This makes wireless charging a breeze, though you must remember to put the Clckr back on before leaving the house. 

Current Amazon users said they liked the design, card storage, and security the Clckr provided. Still, some customers said they experienced breaking early and thought the magnet was weak. 

**Clckr MagSafe wallet features:** Multi-functional | **Dimensions:** 0.38 x 2.44 x 3.94 inches | **Card capacity:** Holds two cards comfortably

### Best MagSafe Wallet with an ID slot

The Satechi Magnetic Wallet stand combines an affordable yet premium luxury build and design with everyday functionality. With four card slots and a designated space for your ID, there's a spot for your essential cards to keep you on the go. 

ZDNET reviewer Adrian Kingsley-Hughes calls Satechi's model the perfect balance of style and functionality. "The main thing I like about this wallet is the build quality," Kingsley-Hughes wrote in his review. "The materials look and feel premium, and the construction is such that it will not fall apart without a real fight." 

**Also:** [**I've tested dozens of MagSafe wallets on my iPhone, and this is one you should buy**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-magsafe-wallets-on-my-iphone-and-this-is-one-you-should-buy/)

The Satechi wallet can also double as a phone stand, oriented horizontally or vertically. It is made of scratch-resistant vegan leather that is easy to wipe clean. Equipped with strong magnets, the Satechi wallet is MagSafe, and you can be assured it won't fall off the back of your device. 

Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet's sturdiness, robust hinge mechanism, and quality. However, some users said the magnet needed to be stronger. 

If you're looking for a clean, premium phone wallet, the Satechi delivers with a rugged yet elegant design and build. 

**Satechi Magnetic Wallet Stand features:** Multi-functional | **Dimensions:** 4.1 x 2.6 x 0.4 inches | **Card capacity:** 4 cards

### Best minimalist MagSafe wallet

This MagSafe wallet and stand combo combines minimalist luxury with functionality. Inspired by origami, the Moft wallet can hold up to three cards and quickly flips into a stand. It's ultra-thin, practically unseen, and unfelt while attached to your device. 

The Moft wallet also features uber-strong magnets designed to stack with the brand's other products, like its [MagSafe battery pack](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/). This ensures you can keep all your favorite cards at your fingertips and still charge your phone without removing the wallet. 

When I tested this wallet during my commute, I was impressed with its overall aesthetic and look -- it's super sophisticated and sleek. However, I found it challenging to remove cards, especially when using public transit, and three cards (my ID, NJ Transit card, and debit card) felt a little too snug for my liking. But for someone on the go more often (or someone who needs less card capacity), this is a winner. It comes in seven punchy colors, truly elevates your phone's look, and ensures that you are never without a way to prop up your device. The Moft stand is a favorite at ZDNET, and editor Sabrina Ortiz regularly uses one on her phone. 

I'd be remiss not to mention that while this isn't a preferred pick for commuting, I do reach for it often while at home or doing casual errands or activities. It's also been a great option for the pool and beach now that summer is here because of its less bulky construction, and it's such a multifunctional add-on for anyone that my mother usurped my original test unit (I've been told it's a great stand for reading recipes off your phone while cooking or baking). 

Customers on the Moft website said they liked the strong magnets, premium look and feel, and card capacity of the Snap-on wallet. Some customers said the fabric within the folds did not hold up well, while others remained impressed with the wallet's overall function. 

**Moft Snap on Phone Stand and Wallet features:** Multi-functional | **Dimensions:** 0.8 x 2.5 x 0.24 inches **Card capacity:** three cards

### Best MagSafe wallet for fun color or customization

Casetify offers a basic yet sleek MagSafe wallet for storing your cards with easy access. The wallet features built-in RFID technology to protect your card information, a card port on the back, and is made from 50% recycled materials. 

It's compatible with MagSafe phones and cases and has several colors and Casetify-exclusive designs. You can even customize your wallet with words, initials, or phrases. When I tested this MagSafe wallet last month, I liked the various design options and the overall simplicity. You can store up to three cards, but it wasn't convenient for storing folded cash. I used it to hold my NJ Transit card and debit card, and I would have to check to ensure I didn't lose any bills every time I took a card out. 

The simple design is great for card storage at a festival, bar, or other event, but it didn't work as well for my commute. Although there's a card port on the back that helps nudge cards out, it was a bit annoying and inconvenient. I'd have to remove the wallet to access my transit card when it became tricky to take out. I much prefer having a notch on the front of the wallet when using it for commuting purposes. 

Current Casetify users said they liked the wallet's texture and overall design, along with the different designs and color options. Similarly to my experience, one customer said the wallet was perfect for specific use cases. "For certain occasions, this mag wallet has been perfect. The wallet is constructed very well and has a slot big enough for your credit card and ID," the customer wrote. 

**Casetify MagSafe wallet features:** Protects from magnetic damage | Card port for easy access | **Card capacity:** two cards

## ESR HaloLock wallet

### Best MagSafe wallet for a traditional wallet feel

If you're looking to stick to an old-school look and don't need as much card storage as the Journey Ezmo wallet, the ESR HaloLock is a traditional flip-and-fold wallet that takes on what's becoming a modern classic. It's made with vegan leather and metallic mesh lining, and it indeed looks like you stuck a high-end, luxury wallet to the back of your phone. On the front fold, there's a slot for one card, giving easy access to your most important card. 

**Also:** [**ESR HaloLock Wallet Stand hands-on**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/esr-halolock-wallet-stand-hands-on/)

When the wallet is flipped open, two more slots have a clear window that is optimal for your ID. The HaloLock also doubles as a kickstand, adjusting to any angle from 15 to 160 degrees. 

ZDNET's Matthew Miller tested the ESR wallet in 2022 and liked its slim and stylish design. "I have had great success using it with a Peak Design Everyday Case, so it is possible to use it with a MagSafe case. The vegan leather material is supple and feels good in the hand. The stitching appears to be solid, and the stand has held up extremely well," Miller said. 

Current Amazon customers said they like the wallet's appearance, strength, performance, and size. Many customers said the wallet holds the phone securely vertically and horizontally, and they also liked the card capacity, quality, and ease of use.

**ESR HaloLock wallet features:** **Dimensions:** 4.13 x 2.6 x 0.3 inches | **Card capacity:** Up to three cards

Pros 
* Two different, secure compartments make it easy to hold cash and four cards
* Secure and durable
* Strong magnet

Cons 
* Hard to get open
* A little bulky

## Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder

### Best MagSafe wallet for keeping items secure

We get it -- you're not entirely cashless, and maybe you never will be. So, while many options on this list are excellent choices for your ID, debit card, and work badge, you will only do you good if your payment of choice is a good old Benjamin. 

Rather than featuring a pocket design, the Pelican swings open on hinges -- like a door -- to reveal two grip-secured compartments: one is optimal for cards and the other for cash. A snap-on closure secures both compartments and closes the "door."

When ZDNET's Christina Darby tested the Pelican wallet, she struggled to obtain her goods. "The only downside to the clasp is that it's almost too secure; I feel I have to pry it open to get my cards out. I've even broken a nail in the process." Darby wrote. However, she said the extra security gave her peace of mind, especially in large crowds. 

Darby also noted that the Pelican's magnet is one of the strongest on any MagSafe accessory she tested, adding even more security. The main downside of the Pelican is its bulkiness compared to the other options on this list. However, according to Darby, it still fits comfortably in a back pocket. 

Current Amazon users said they liked the wallet's sleek and minimal appearance, but some customers said they have mixed opinions on its durability. 

**Pelican magnetic wallet and card holder features:** **Dimensions:** 3.97 x 2.79 x 0.47 inches | **Card capacity:** Holds up to 4 cards plus cash

## Which is the right MagSafe wallet for you?

MagSafe wallets are a practical option for those who use their phone as their primary always-on-them accessory. While some MagSafe wallets only offer basic storage for a few cards, others also double or triple as a kickstand, phone grip, or cash storage device, possibly converting your phone into the ultimate multitasking tool. 

ZDNET considered all those factors along with budget and use case to make selection easy. Here's how the best MagSafe wallets stack up with each other and which one may be the best fit for you.

## Factors to consider when choosing the best MagSafe wallet for you:

We chose these MagSafe wallets through a mix of hands-on testing, carefully curated research, and consideration of each product's everyday need and functionality. We also considered the following when making our top selections, and recommend keeping these in mind when making your own final decision. 

* **Practicality:** These wallets aim to maximize efficiency. They all hold at least two of your most essential cards for easy access without adding too much weight or bulk to your phone, while potentially offering even more. Consider the amount of card storage you want to help narrow your search. If you're looking for storage for less than two, try checking out the best cardholders.
* **Versatility:** When making my final selections, I considered MagSafe wallets that may not fit every card you have but can add extra functionality or use for what they lack in card space. I also thought about how well they functioned during my day-to-day activities, which included my commute from NJ to NYC. Remember how versatile (or not) you want your wallet to be. Do you care if it doubles as a stand? A battery pack? Or do you just need card storage?
* **Durability:** Your wallet is essential in your daily life, and the same rule applies when considering wallet wallets affixed to your phone. No matter which product you select, you want it to last, especially if you're paying more than a few bucks. After extensive ZDNET testing and research, we intentionally chose wallets that will last you more than a few weeks. Be sure to consider if you're looking to make a long-term investment for a wallet accessory or need something quick for an event, vacation, festival, or other.
* **Budget:** As always, setting a budget to help you narrow your search parameters is a good idea. If you're looking to invest in a MagSafe wallet accessory long term, spending $45 or more would probably be worth it. If you're only looking to use a MagSafe wallet for a few days or one event, it's probably not worth your money to spend more than $40\.
* **Occasion**: Like your phone case, any accessory you affix to your phone becomes an extension of your personality. Consider the type of design or color you'd like (especially if your wallet will become a mainstay of your cell), and consider how you'll be using a phone wallet. Is it for everyday use? Special occasions? Events here and there? Narrowing down how you want to use your wallet can help you ultimately set a budget and decide on necessary features.

## How did we choose these MagSafe wallets?

ZDNET went hands-on with all the MagSafe wallets on this list. We spend time using these wallets on our own iPhones during daily lives to test out card storage, magnetic strength, comfort, usability, and more -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you "add-in" this product to your life and benefit from its presence? Or, is it another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? 

If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. 

Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. 

## Which phones are MagSafe compatible?

The iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15, and iPhone 15 Pro are all MagSafe compatible. Unfortunately, the iPhone 12 and [13 Mini models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-mini-lives-the-case-for-buying-it-in-2022/) don't feature MagSafe, and therefore can not be used with MagSafe accessories, however, there are MagSafe rings sold separately that can convert non-MagSafe cases into MagSafe compatible cases. 

## Do I need a specific phone case to use a MagSafe wallet?

Ideally, you should equip your phone with a [MagSafe phone case](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQU73ZM/A/iphone-14-silicone-case-with-magsafe-canary-yellow?tag=zdnet-deals-20), which also helps to protect your phone if you're looking to add a MagSafe wallet. You can find MagSafe phone cases at Apple, or other retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. 

## How do I know if my phone is MagSafe?

The iPhone 12 through iPhone 15 models (minus the Mini) feature MagSafe technology. If you're not sure what type of iPhone you have, go to **Settings > General >** **About,** and you'll see what model your phone is.

## What does RFID mean?

According to the [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/radio-frequency-identification-rfid-what-it), RFID refers to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. This technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects. 

There are devices that can read information contained in a wireless device or "tag" from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight -- for example, the chips in credit or debit cards. Wallets which feature RFID-blocking technology prevent these devices from accessing information stored in protected chips, which can help prevent your bank information from being compromised. 

## Do MagSafe wallets ruin credit cards?

No. MagSafe wallets will not damage your cards or make them unusable, though bending, breaking, chipping, and normal wear and tear can occur just as with traditional wallets. 

## Other MagSafe wallets we've tested

Although we've gone hands-on with the products on our list, there are tons of other MagSafe wallet options available on the market. Here are a few alternatives that we've tested which offer strong magnetic grip and great card storage. 

[Best MagSafe wallet for Apple lovers Apple's iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe Absolutely no one is shocked that the original proprietor of MagSafe technology has also created its own MagSafe wallet, and the latest version even integrates Apple's Find My NFC tracking feature. According to ZDNET's Jason Cipriani, who tested the discontinued leather version, it looks "identical to the original version," with quality materials, fine stitching, and room for three cards, and it magnetically snaps on your phone the same way. This iteration of Apple's flagship wallet is made of FineWoven material, the same being used in the brand's FineWoven cases.

However, I love this MagSafe accessory. The stand is easy to flip up, the magnet is strong, my card is secure, the designs are fun, and accessing the card is simple. I tested this for several days during my NJ/NYC commute where it stored my NJ Transit card, and swiping my card was a seamless task. If you're a one-card type or need something for select occasions, I highly recommend this cardholder.

It comes in a classic tan color as well as four other options, including a sparkly design.
