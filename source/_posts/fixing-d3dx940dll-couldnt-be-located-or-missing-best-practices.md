 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without changing the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest release even if your version is technically the same. The same DirectX installation program works with all versions of Windows and will replace any missing DirectX files.
2. Install the version of DirectX that came with the program. Look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD.  
 If a program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will often include an installable copy of DirectX on the setup disc. Sometimes, the DirectX version included on the disc will work better with the program than the latest version available online.
3. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that's showing the error. This will sometimes replace the missing or corrupted d3dx9\_25.dll file.
