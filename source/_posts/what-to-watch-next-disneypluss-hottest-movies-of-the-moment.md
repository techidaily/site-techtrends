 In the market for an iPad? The newest generations from Apple give you all of the latest features, and mean your tablet will receive software support and updates for years to come.

## iPad Pro

 The iPad Pro is Apple's most technologically advanced tablet, and it was the first to use the company's stylus, the[Apple Pencil](https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-use-apple-pencil-ipad-3876369) . The 2022 iPad Pro supports the Pencil 2, which works without touching the screen. The latest iPad Pro is the first iPad to run on Apple's M2 processor, and the cellular model boasts 5G support, making it the fastest tablet on the market.

 The iPad Pro currently comes in two sizes. The 11-inch iPad Pro comes with a 128GB hard drive, while the latter is available with 128GB or 2TB. Otherwise, the hardware is the same.

 All that said, they're missing the same features that other tablets have. Specifically, neither has a[Home button](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ipad-home-button-1994353) , which means you can't secure it with a fingerprint using[Touch ID](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-touch-id-4586807) . However, both models support[Face ID](https://www.lifewire.com/face-id-4151714) , which locks your iPad until the camera sees your face. The iPad Pro doesn't have a headphone jack, either, so you'll need an adapter or a set of[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) headphones to listen to music privately.

 For speed, storage, and overall performance, these are the most heavyweight tablets Apple sells.

## iPad Air

 The iPad Air is currently in its fifth generation, released in 2022\. The iPad Air 5 is the first non-Pro model to include Apple's M1 chip, which means it's just as fast as the larger offerings.

 It's compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil, which means you can make full use of some of the[advanced creativity apps](https://www.lifewire.com/best-apps-for-ipad-pro-pencil-4177139) that the stylus was made for. It also has a[True Tone display](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-true-tone-display-4048131) , which adjusts the color and brightness of the screen based on ambient conditions.

 Like the fourth-generation model, the iPad Air 5 doesn't have a Home button. Instead, it integrates Home's functionality, including Touch ID, into the Sleep/Wake button at the top of the device. This model also has a 10.9-inch display with a resolution of 2360 x 1640, which brings it even closer in size to the Pro.

 The fift-generation iPad Air supports USB-C, so you can use USB-C storage devices and chargers.

 The newest iPad Mini is the sixth generation of the small-sized Apple tablet. The Mini is the choice for people who want a smaller, more portable tablet.

 Its screen is 8.3 inches, which is smaller than the ones on other models. But it's compatible with the Apple Pencil and packs a powerful A15 Bionic chip with a 16-core Neural Engine. The Mini is similar to the larger tablet; the only significant difference is its size.

## iPad

 The 2022 model is the tenth version of the iPad. Apple aimed this less-featured iPad toward casual tablet users and educators. The current 10.2-inch model supports the first-generation Apple Pencil as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio.

 It carries an A14 Bionic processor, promises up to 10 hours of battery life from its 32.4 watt-hour cell battery, and has seen a huge camera upgrade over its predecessor, with an 8 MP rear camera and a 12 MP Ultra-Wide set up in the front.

 Available in four different colors with 64GB or 256GB of storage, the newest entry-level iPad includes a USB-C port. In addition, the front-facing camera has been moved so that video calls don't look off-center.

 It's the best pick for people who want an Apple tablet but don't need all of the features and performance of the other models.
