## Free Online Fax Solutions - Discover the Best 7 Options Today
 Faxing may seem outdated, but many organizations still conduct business via fax. There's no need to invest in a fax machine or computer fax modem, however. Free online fax services allow you to send faxes from your computer and receive them in your email.

 The free fax offerings from these services may have limited features. Read carefully before choosing one.

 What We Don't Like

* Weekly fax receipts to keep your number.

 If you expect to receive many faxes or want to send faxes in various formats, the FaxBetter Premium account starts at $5.95 per month for up to 500 pages per month, and two cents per page after that (although, at this price, you have to pay upfront for two years). This plan also includes unlimited fax storage, searchable fax notifications, and no advertising.
