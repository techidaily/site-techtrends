## How to Use LG Screen Share With Android

 One way to view your smartphone on an LG TV is with Screen Mirroring. Almost all Android phones have this capability.

 LG labels its TV screen mirroring feature as Screen Share, but the function on different brands and models of smartphones may be referred to as any of the following:

* Screen Share or Smart Share (LG)
* [Miracast](https://www.lifewire.com/miracast-wireless-connectivity-1846853)
* Smart View
* Wireless Display (aka WiDi)
* Display Mirroring
* HTC Connect
* [Wi-Fi Direct](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wifi-direct-4685654)

 Here's how to use LG's Screen Share with Android phones:

1. Select**Screen Share** on your LG TV.  
![LG Smart TV Screen Share Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHtO3vP7h9ZFrngIqtX4T75_Q0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-tv-screen-share-page-test-1500-XXX-f0f1dfe7cfce4e088e91b4dfafde5ac7.jpg)
2. On your phone, open the**Settings** app and select the screen mirroring feature.  

![Android phone choose screen mirroring to LG Smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NyKRXMCTWL8cpXHkvLIPnvK91l4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HTC-ONE-settings-choose-select-lg-tv-520c045367fe43e7a9e3a1bf247cac72.jpg)  
 In the remaining steps, the phone (HTC Android) is on the left and the LG TV screen is on the right.

3. Select your TV to initiate the connection. It might take a few moments for the phone to detect the TV. Both devices will display their connection status.

4. Your smartphone's or tablet's screen will be displayed on the LG TV when the process is completed.

5. Here's how mirrored content from a smartphone looks on an LG Smart TV with Screen Share.

6. To end a screen mirroring session, tap**Disconnect** in your phone's screen mirroring settings (if provided), turn the device off, change to a different function on the TV, or turn the TV off. If you're playing content from a specific app, it will cease playing if you use another function on your smartphone.

## Screen Mirroring With iPhones and iPads

 If you have an[LG TV that supports Apple AirPlay 2](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fhelp-library%2Fhow-to-use-airplay-what-lg-tvs-support-airplay-2-CT10000020-20151097893431) , you can[stream directly from your iPhone or iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/airplay-from-iphone-to-tv-5194877) . Just open**Home Dashboard** on your TV and go to**AirPlay** \>**AirPlay and HomeKit Settings** \>**AirPlay** .

 If your LG smart TV isn't AirPlay 2 compatible, possible workarounds include:

* **Third-party apps** : Certain apps allow screen mirroring from an iPhone/iPad to an LG Smart TV, including[TV Cast Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tv-cast-pro-for-lg-webos/id1126058329) and[AirBeam](https://www.airbeam.tv/mirror-iphone-ipad-screen/lg/) . LG doesn't guarantee third-party screen mirroring apps will work on all LG Smart TVs; some of these apps may also be used with Android phones.
* **Indirect screen mirroring** : This can be done from an iPhone/iPad to an Apple TV or Chromecast device, which in turn passes the mirrored content to an LG TV via an HDMI connection.

 To[use an iPhone with Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/cast-to-chromecast-from-iphone-5207346) , the iPhone needs to be running iOS 15 or higher.

## Screen Mirroring From PC to an LG Smart TV

 You can also mirror a PC or laptop to an LG TV by searching for the TV from your computer.

1. Open the**Screen Share** app on your TV.  
![LG Smart TV Screen Share Option](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHtO3vP7h9ZFrngIqtX4T75_Q0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-tv-screen-share-page-test-1500-XXX-f0f1dfe7cfce4e088e91b4dfafde5ac7.jpg)

## Cast Smartphone Content to an LG Smart TV

 Another way to view content from an Android phone on an LG Smart TV is via casting.

 LG Smart TVs incorporate DIAL (Discovery and Launch). This allows the casting of select apps (like YouTube and Netflix) directly from an Android phone or tablet to an LG Smart TV without having to plug in an additional Chromecast device.

 Here are some things to know about this:

* All devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network.
* Casting using the DIAL system only works with select apps.
* Only content is shown on the TV screen. Your phone's settings, home screen, etc., are not mirrored.
* While casted content is playing on your TV, you can perform other tasks on your smartphone at the same time or even turn it off.
* If an Android smartphone or tablet app is compatible with casting using the DIAL system, a Cast Logo will appear on the phone screen.
* The app you are casting needs to be installed on both the smartphone/tablet and TV.

 Follow these steps to use this feature:

1. With the TV on, open YouTube or another compatible app on your phone.  
 The app you want to cast from must be installed on your mobile device and your TV.
2. Tap the**Cast** icon at the top of the screen of the chosen app, then tap the TV you want to cast to. The media will begin playing.  
![Cast YouTube to LG Smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jWT5sXqTMWE8Bg-V39yWX-CCogc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cast-you-tube-to-lg-smart-tv-1-2-yellow-efd95f194cdb4908a3321b98e97bb2de.jpg)  
 If you see the cast icon but your TV isn't listed as an available device, then the content can't be cast to the LG TV without an external Chromecast device.

## The Content Share Option

 While Screen Share is the most direct way to mirror a smartphone or PC screen on your smart TV, LG provides additional options via the TV's Device Connector settings.

![LG Smart TV – Device Connector Icon on Home Screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qw-X7F8OC8KOcavYDWXwN4HFSGY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-tv-device-connect-home-screen-app-icon1900-dark-yellow-bbb-1ddcb6818a5b4532bea7ebd0ab894c6b.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 When the Device Connector is selected from the home screen, you're taken to a menu that includes connection options for all devices, including a smartphone or PC.

![LG TV Device Connector Menu – Smartphone and PC Highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UcrKTZRJKkxZfNIqdbkvv8ublUY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-tv-device-connector-alt-a-31cba54fe9934fd6b86358d1f57037b6.jpg)

 The Screen Share app can also be accessed by the LG TV's Device Connector in addition to direct access from the home menu. However, since its function was discussed earlier, the following focuses on the**Content Share** option, which can only be accessed within the Device Connector.

### Device Connector Smartphone Connection Prompt

 Select**Content Share** and you'll be guided through steps on your smartphone and LG TV.

 When the steps are completed, you'll see a photo, music, and video file sharing menu on your LG TV screen. This allows you to play compatible files in those categories from your smartphone on your LG TV.

### Device Connector PC Connection Prompt

 Content Share also allows an LG Smart TV to access and play compatible music, photo, and video files stored on a PC or Laptop.

 After selecting Content Share for PCs and going through prompted connection steps on your PC and TV, you'll see a photo, music, and video file sharing menu on your TV. When you select a category, you'll be able to display compatible files stored on your PC.
