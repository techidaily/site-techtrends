## The Ultimate Guide to Watching The Matrix Series From Beginning to End
### What to Know

* Chronological order:_The Matrix_ ,_The Matrix Reloaded_ ,_The Matrix Revolutions_ , and_The Matrix Resurrections_ .
* True chronological order: Watch the_Matrix_ movies with the nine animated_Animatrix_ films (also by the Wachowskis).

 How often have you looked through your window and wondered if the world you live in is just in your mind? Any number at all puts you squarely in the Matrix club, where Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) explore the reality that what they believed was real was, in fact, not.

 These_Matrix_ movies have fascinated watchers since their release, and there's no better time than the present to binge through the whole series.

## How to Watch the Matrix Movies in Release Order

 If you're only tangentially familiar with the_Matrix_ movies, then you probably are wondering what more is there to know. The truth is, just like with the Matrix, there's more than meets the eye. That's because_The Matrix Trilogy_ and the 2021_Matrix_ sequel are just the tip of the iceberg.

 Though the four main_Matrix_ movies,_The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions_ , and_The Matrix Resurrections_ , were released in chronological order,[the Wachowskis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FWachowskis) , who are responsible for writing and directing the films, also created nine other animated films which fall under the series_The Animatrix_ , and are part of the Matrix story.

 In addition to_The Matrix Trilogy_ , the 2021_Matrix_ sequel, and the _Animatrix_  movies, three games go along with the series._Enter the Matrix_ (2003),_The Matrix Online_ (2005), and_The Matrix: Path of Neo_ (2005) are separate from this discussion of the films, but you should know they do exist.

 Knowing this, when you're ready to binge on_The Matrix_ movies, you should first watch_The Matrix Trilogy_ and the 2021 sequel_The Matrix Resurrections_ , and then go back and watch_The Animatrix_ movies and_The Matrix_ movies in chronological order.

 If a title isn't available on a particular streaming service, you can usually rent or buy it from Amazon, Apple TV, or Google Play.
