 When the process is finished, perform a Windows update again to see if it still takes much longer than usual. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 **Outdated or corrupted drivers on your PC can also trigger this issue** . For example, if your network driver is outdated or corrupted, it may slow down your download speed, so Windows updates may take much longer than before. To fix this issue, you need to update your drivers.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the official website of your PC manufacturer and searching for the latest driver for each device on your PC.

 Be sure to choose the driver**that’s compatible with your exact PC model** and **your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from**the manufacturer** . They‘re **all certified safe and secure** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click**Update** next to any device to download the correct version of its driver, and then you can install it manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Driver-Easy-Update-All.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact**Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Fix 3: Reset Windows Update components

 This issue may occur if there’s something wrong with Windows Update components. If Windows Update components are corrupted, Windows Update may not work properly. In this case, try resetting Windows Update components. Here is how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type **cmd** and press**Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Enter** at the same time to **run Command Prompt as administrator** . You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open the Command Prompt.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Snap468.png)

 2) In Command Prompt, type the command lines below and press**Enter** on your keyboard **after typing each** :

**net stop bits**  
**net stop wuauserv**  
**net stop appidsvc**  
**net stop cryptsvc**

**net stop bits** **net stop wuauserv** **net stop appidsvc** **net stop cryptsvc**

 The Windows Update related system services will be stopped after executing the command lines above.

 3) In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press**Enter** after typing each:

**ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old**
**ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.old**

 You will**rename** the**SoftwareDistribution and catroot2** folder as **SoftwareDistribution.old and catroot2.old** after you run these two command lines. These two folders are used by Windows Update to save temporary update files.

 By renaming these two folders, **Windows will think these two folders are missing, and Windows will create new ones to store Windows update files.** By doing that, you can avoid many Windows Update issues caused by the old corrupted temporary files in these two folders.

 4) In Command Prompt, type the following command lines and press**Enter** after each:

**net start bits**  
**net start wuauserv**  
**net start appidsvc**  
**net start cryptsvc**

 After executing the command lines above, you start the Windows Update related system services.

 Check to see if this resolves your Windows Update problem. Hopefully, it did. But if not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Run the DISM tool

 This issue is probably caused by the corrupted Windows update files. In this case, running   **the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool** may resolve this issue. Just follow the step-by-step instructions to run the DISM tool:

 1) On your keyboard, press**the Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Type**cmd**  and then press**Ctrl** , **Shift** , and **Enter**  on your keyboard at the same time to **run the Command Prompt as administrator** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to run**Command Prompt** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap245.jpg)

 2) On your keyboard, type the command lines below one by one and press**Enter** .

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap1-2.jpg)

 When you run the command mentioned above, the DISM tool will scan all the system files and compare them with official system files. The function of this command line is to see if the system file on your PC is consistent with its official source or not. This command line doesn’t fix the corruption. It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap2-5.jpg)

 When you run the command line **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth** , the DISM tool will check whether your Windows 10 image has corruptions or not. This command line also doesn’t repair the corrupted files. It may take several minutes for this command operation to be completed.

**Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**
