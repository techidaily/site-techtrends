## Chronic Inflammation

Google Pixel phones might be the most iPhone-like Android phone, complete with Google's vision of a pure Android software and hardware experience. The Pixel 9 series has now arrived, with three models to choose from and a folding variant.

 Google has just unveiled the Pixel 9 range at today's Made by Google event. Without counting the foldable model, we have three phones here rather than the usual two models. There's the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro, and finally the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The regular Pixel 9 Pro now has the same screen size as the regular Pixel 9, so now the XL is the bigger option. There's also the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-poco-x6-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) to consider, if you're in the market for a folding phone.

Google 

 All three phones are powered by the Tensor G4 processor, paired with 12GB RAM on the base Pixel 9, or a whopping 16GB RAM on the two Pixel 9 Pro models. The Pixel 9 Pro has Google's most advanced camera system yet, with a pro triple rear camera and a fully upgraded 42MP front camera. It also introduces Super Res Zoom to video and allows users to enhance videos to 8K resolution with Video Boost. The Pixel 9, on the other hand, offers an impressive 50MP main lens and a new 48MP ultrawide camera for stunning photos and videos.

Google 

 Both phones come with upgraded displays, with the Pixel 9 Pro sporting a "Super Actua" display that Google says is its most immersive yet. The phone is available in two sizes, 6.3" and 6.8", for the first time. The Pixel 9 boasts a 6.3-inch Actua display that is sharper, more vibrant, and 35% brighter than its predecessor.

The Pixel Watch 3 and Buds Pro 2 might look familiar, but Google gave the Pixel 9 series a bold new look.

 The Pixel 9 series announcement happened earlier than usual, as Google tends to announce its phones around September or October. It's possible that Google moved up its hardware launches this year so it wouldn't have to compete for attention as muchâ€”Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone 16 series soon. We'll have to see how well an August announcement works out this time.

 The [Pixel 9](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F9) and [Pixel 9 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F9%5Fpro) are available in a range of colors and start at $799 and $999, respectively. The [Pixel 9 Pro XL](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F9%5Fpro), the bigger model, will set you back $1,099\. You can now pre-order the phones from the Google Store, and they should appear at carriers and other retailers soon.
