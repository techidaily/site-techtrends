### 4.2: iTunes Not Syncing HEIC Photos

HEIC photos undoubtedly outputs a better image quality and smaller storage space. Thus iPhone users gradually record photos in .heic format since iOS 11\. But it's a pity that some users find that some photos are not synchronized by itunes including HEIC photos. In the beginning, an error message "xx of those files could not be synced" popped up. But actually more photos than prompts weren't synced and some of them are HEIC photos. It cannot be denied that iOS and iTunes update could result in this iTunes photos sync problem as well, but HEIC still a big issue. 

1\. Ungrade iOS and iTunes to the latest version (If it already is, reinstall it to exclude the improper software installation).

2\. Convert HEIC photos to JPG for better compatibility. MacX MediaTrans is a nice option. [Check how to convert HEIC to JPG](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

## 5\. iTunes Cannot Sync Movies or TV shows

### 5.1: Movie Was Not Copied to This iPhone

Watching movies through iPhone iPad on the go is increasingly a new trend. If you have some movies on your computer hard drive, transferring them to iPhone is a good idea to make them accessible anytime anywhere. However, when you syncing movies to iPhone with iTunes, an error message "\[movie\] was not copied to the iPhone \[name\] because it cannot be played on this iPhone" drives you crazy. The most probable cause is that the iPhone lacks codecs support in which movie file was encoded. Another possibility is that the resolution of the video is too high for your device to handle. Whatever the reason, the solution is to convert the movie to the appropriate format. 

![iTunes cannot sync photos to iPhone](https://www.macxdvd.com/itunes/article-image/itunes-movies-not-copied.jpg)

1\. Add the movie/video to iTunes library, make sure you have "Film" group selected before adding to iTunes Library. 

2\. Select it and go to the menu bar and select File > Convert and choose "Create iPod or iPhone Version", you video starts converting.

3\. Delete the original one from the list. Then sync the converted one to iPhone.

### 5.2: iTunes Won't Transfer HEVC to iPhone

Comparing to H.264, HEVC delivers 50% reduction of bit rate and the same high video quality. Thus, many users would like to encode a video file to HEVC/H.265 for playing on iPhone iPad. But the process didn't go that well since iTunes fails, saying that it can't transfer because the file is not compatible with my iDevice. Ultimately, it's a matter of format issue. Thus to solve this problem, you need convert HEVC videos to iPhone MP4 or MOV. 

1\. Create a iPhone version following the steps in #5.1 

2\. Try MacX MediaTrans to automatically convert HEVC videos to iPhone supported MP4, or MOV. 

### 5.3: Cannot Add MP4 to iTunes

Have you ever in a situation that you have a MP4 video, but you cannot add it to iTunes. You choose "Add to library..." and select the file, but nothing happens. In this case, you can go to "Home Video" on iTunes to see whether it's added or not. If it's not added, it must be an issue of the MP4 video itself. Firstly, iTunes only allows MP4 video encoded with H.264, MPEG-4, HEVC, AAC codecs, but not including H.263, MPEG-2 etc. Then if you want to sync MP4 to iPhone via iTunes, the video need to meet the technical specifications of the iPhone like bitrate, size, sample rate and others. 

Solutions to [add MP4 to iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/): 

1\. Convert the so-called MP4 to iTunes/iDevices supported MP4 format with iTunes (#5.1), Handbrake, VideoProc or the like. 

2\. Try an iTunes alternative like MacX MediaTrans to sync and automatically convert videos to iPhone.
