[Our Review of Google Voice](https://www.lifewire.com/google-voice-review-3426683)

 Google Voice has offered visual voicemail for longer than most of the competition. Before Google acquired Google Voice, it was known as Grand Central. Whether you use iPhone or Android, Google Voice is the best free visual voicemail app out there today.

 Google Voice gives you a dedicated, free phone number you can set to ring (or not) on any device you choose. When a new voicemail message arrives, Google Voice sends a transcription right away by email, text, or both.

## [The Best Visual Voicemail App for Access on Any Device: YouMail](https://www.youmail.com/)

![YouMail app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/axqfGcxsKCqY5sEPJaOWvuhJoao=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001-Visual-voicemail-3d8aec660545471fbe131dc8ddc16535.jpg)

 YouMail is an award-winning visual voicemail app for iPhone and Android that lets you read your voice messages. You can view the transcription from your phone, tablet, or computer, browsing transcripts in the order you prefer. You can also have YouMail convert voicemails to email and text message format.

 Much like a Swiss Army Knife, YouMail has a surprisingly massive variety of optional features, like robocall blocking, personalized voicemail greetings, and conference calling.

 What We Like

* Search transcripts functionality.
* Block unwanted callers.
* Assign individual greetings for different callers.

 What We Don't Like

* Only comes with a two-week free trial.

 HulloMail is another terrific visual voicemail app available for iPhone and Android users. You can use it to scan the voicemail messages in your voicemail inbox, then read the transcriptions and decide how you want to follow up. Should you wish, you can send copies of the transcriptions through email.

 If you want unlimited cloud storage for your transcriptions, or the ability to search through transcripts to find a specific message, you may want to level up to a paid subscription plan.

**Download For** :

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/hullomail-voicemail/id341815203)

## [The Best Visual Voicemail App for One-Stop Shopping: InstaVoice](https://instavoice.com/)

 What We Like

* Visual voicemail for up to ten phone numbers.
* Access and handle voicemail in one place.
* Helpful customer support.

 What We Don't Like

* Not as many features as competitors.

 InstaVoice provides visual voicemail transcription, but with a twist. It aims to provide a single interface to manage an unlimited number of voice messages from every phone number you want.

 If you get a ton of voicemail messages on a regular basis, to the point that people tell you they got the dreaded "the mailbox is full" message when calling you, this is the app for you.

 In addition to accessing voice-to-text transcriptions on the spot, you can also call or text the person who left a message by using a chat-like interface within InstaVoice. It's a great way to maintain a large volume of voicemails across multiple phone numbers, handling them with the same speed and efficiency you would a text message or email.
