 In the 1950s, an African American man named Atticus Freeman (Jonathan Majors) travels to the segregated American south to find his missing father. On top of discrimination from locals, Atticus must also deal with the ghosts of slave owners and monsters from H.P Lovecraft's twisted imagination.

_Lovecraft Country_ is based on a book of the same name, inspired by fantasy-horror author H.P Lovecraft, the show's namesake. Some scenes are brutally violent, and it doesn't pull punches when addressing America's history of racism.
