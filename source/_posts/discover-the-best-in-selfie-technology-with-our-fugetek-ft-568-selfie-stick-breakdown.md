 _We purchased the Fugetek FT-568 Professional Bluetooth Selfie Stick so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 The Fugetek FT-568 Professional Bluetooth Selfie Stick is not your average selfie stick, but a professional-grade tool designed with many different uses in mind. While it’s an excellent gadget for the price point, it may not be the best fit for all users. We tested this selfie stick over the course of several weeks in order to see how user-friendly its design was and here’s what we found.

## **Design and Durability: Functionality and size**

 The Fugetek is not your average selfie stick. It’s a premium product with a durable aluminum alloy frame, non-slip rubber handle, and secure clamps to ensure that the selfie stick (once extended) won’t collapse back down or wobble. Its compatible phone mounts can hold devices up to 4.2 inches width, which will handle most smartphones. It can also rotate up to 90-degrees forward and backward, and the mount—once screwed securely in—is adjustable to ensure users can achieve the perfect angle.

 With a standby battery life of up to 300 hours, it can go for days on a single charge. It also has the added benefit of supporting DSLR cameras,[camcorders,](https://www.lifewire.com/best-video-cameras-to-buy-4064602) and GoPro cameras, although GoPro users will need to purchase a separate mount attachment which retails for around $8\.

 Casual users may not need a selfie stick with such reach, though heavier devices are more secure and will benefit from the Fugetek’s sturdy frame.

 It’s worth noting that the Fugetek is quite large for a selfie stick, with a range of 16.8 inches to 49 inches when fully extended. Most[selfie sticks](https://www.lifewire.com/best-selfie-sticks-4048577) top out around 27-35 inches. Casual users may not need a selfie stick with such reach, though heavier devices are more secure and will benefit from the Fugetek’s sturdy frame. Its range also makes it a bit large to store in pockets or small handbags. Users looking for a more discreet selfie stick may prefer a smaller, more compact design.

 Another important consideration is weight, which clocks in at 9.6 ounces without a device attached. While this may not seem like much, once the Fugetek is fully extended and has a phone attached to it, it can really weigh down your arm.

## **Setup: Quick and easy**

 The Fugetek arrives with an instruction pamphlet to get new users up and running, an over-the-shoulder carrying case, one mirror mount, one screw tight mount, a charging cable for the Bluetooth remote control, and the selfie stick itself.

 We found the setup process to be quick and easy. First, we screwed the mount onto the top of the selfie stick, then we secured our[Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s-phones-4156903) in the rubber-gripped frame by screwing the locking mechanism until our phone was secure.

 Next, we detached the Fugetek’s remote control from the selfie stick’s handle and flipped the button on, which enables Fugetek’s Bluetooth capabilities. Freshly shipped selfie sticks often have the remote control turned backwards, so you should check the handle if you don’t see it in the box.

 Another important consideration is its weight, which clocks in at 9.6 ounces without a device attached. While this may not seem like much, once the Fugetek is fully extended and has a suitable device attached, this can really add up.

 Last, we enabled[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) on our[smartphone](https://www.lifewire.com/what-makes-a-smartphone-smart-579597) and searched for Fugetek to pop up in pairing selection. It took up to 30-seconds for the Fugetek to appear, so be patient. Once it appeared, we were able to pair the devices quickly and smoothly.

 One issue we ran into was that the native camera app for Android needs to be updated to set the volume keys to associate with the zoom feature, at least on our Samsung Galaxy S8\. Once we’d done this, the provided Bluetooth remote was able to piggy-back off of that functionality so that we could zoom in or out with the Fugetek’s remote control. Unfortunately for iPhone, GoPro, DSLR, and camcorder users, this will not be an option as the zoom feature via the remote control is not supported for devices beyond Android. If zooming on selfies is a must, users may want to look elsewhere.

## **Price: Professional quality for a great price**

 The price for selfie sticks, particularly quality selfie sticks, can range from $20-$100\. The Fugetek generally retails for around $20, which is an excellent price for the features users receive such as the durable aluminum alloy frame, multiple mount options, remote control, and Bluetooth connectivity.

## **Competition: Wired or Bluetooth?**

 With so many different selfie stick options to choose from, competition is fierce, and it’s not always easy to know which model is most suited to your needs. When comparing the Fugetek FT-568 Professional Bluetooth Selfie Stick to other models, the most important consideration is Bluetooth connectivity versus a wired connection. Here, the wired JETech Battery Free Selfie Stick is a budget-buy that stands apart from the pack.

 The JETech Battery Free Selfie Stick is a gadget that’s quite different from the Fugetek. It connects to a smartphone via a 3.5 mm cable that plugs directly into a phone’s headphone jack. This means that as soon as its plugged in and nested into the frame, your phone is ready to snap those selfies. It’s also less than half the weight of the Fugetek at a meager 4 ounces, and can collapse down to a mere 7.2 inches, making it significantly smaller than the 16.8 inches the Fugetek can break down to.

 Since it’s battery-free, it relies on a phone’s charge to draw power. This feature makes it an excellent choice for a more casual user who simply wants to put the selfie stick in a handbag or pocket and carry it along for impromptu shots without worrying about charging. It takes less planning than the Fugetek which is bulky and has a battery that will inevitably need to be charged at some point.

 If Bluetooth connectivity is preferred, a good option is the Mpow Selfie Stick Bluetooth. This model collapses down to 7.1 inches or can extend up to 31.9 inches, and it only weighs 4.3 ounces. The battery life is somewhat short compared to the Fugetek, but it’s perfect for a day of casual shooting or three to four hours of more frequent use. If you’re traveling or out and about, it may be prudent to bring a portable charger.

 Final Verdict

**A professional-grade selfie stick.**

 The Fugetek FT-568 Professional Bluetooth Selfie Stick is an excellent sturdy, durable selfie stick for users who may be inclined to take longer, hard-to-reach camera shots or who are looking to pair this gadget with a camcorder, GoPro, or DSLR camera. For the more casual user, however, this selfie stick may be a bit more than is reasonably needed.
