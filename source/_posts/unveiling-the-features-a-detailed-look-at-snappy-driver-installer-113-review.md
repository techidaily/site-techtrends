## Snappy Driver Installer Pros & Cons

 I've used this software off and on many times, and I can't find much to dislike about it.

 What We Like

* Downloads drivers directly through the program so you don't need to use a web browser.
* Can download drivers for use offline.
* Supports bulk driver downloads and installs.
* Downloads at full, unrestricted speeds.
* No limit to the number of downloads and updates you can perform.
* Completely free from advertisements.
* Will optionally create a Restore Point before driver installs.
* It's portable, so it doesn't need to be installed.

 What We Don't Like

* It's a little confusing to use.
* Can't create a schedule that checks for updates.

## My Thoughts on Snappy Driver Installer

 This is a nice program for not only finding which of your devices require a driver update but also finding the specific, proper driver that devices need,_as well as_ actually installing the driver for you.

 Unfortunately, Snappy Driver Installer isn't nearly as easy to use as similar programs like[Driver Booster](https://www.lifewire.com/driver-booster-review-2619190) , but it's still pretty self-explanatory. After having the program download the driver updates your computer needs, you can use the side menu to select and install all of them.

 Something I should mention again is how Snappy Driver Installer can be used for offline driver updates. I love this feature because it means I can download_lots_ of drivers for many different devices at once, but not install any of them on my computer. I can then load those drivers into Snappy Driver Installer on any computer, even if it doesn't have a network connection.

[Download Snappy Driver Installer](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin/)

 This download includes a few[EXE](https://www.lifewire.com/exe-file-2622732) files. One is called_SDIO\_x64_ and is for[64-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) versions of Windows. See[How to Tell if You Have Windows 64-Bit or 32-Bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you need help choosing the right one.
