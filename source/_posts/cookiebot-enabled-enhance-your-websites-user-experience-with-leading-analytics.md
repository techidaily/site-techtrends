## ABBYY Digital Intelligence selected by Paragon Customer Communications to drive digital transformation

October 14, 2020

![ShutterStock](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/branchtemplates/shutterstock_1272462163_1296-x-729.jpg?h=729&iar=0&w=1296)

ABBYY, a digital intelligence company, has announced a collaboration with Paragon Customer Communications – the leading provider of insightful customer communications solutions – that is expected to further accelerate the Paragon’s wider digital transformation offering.

The strategic partnership between the two companies will create enhanced efficiencies supporting Paragon’s delivery of frictionless customer communications for its clients.

By teaming up with ABBYY, and utilising the company’s content intelligence platform, 90% of Paragon’s inbound workload can now be processed by the innovative digital solution. ABBYY’s software handles the capture, extraction, and categorisation of inbound communications for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

Integration of the ABBYY technology into Paragon’s inbound proprietary Integr8 technology platform means Paragon is able to reduce reliance on manually sorting and categorising millions of documents, supporting their clients’ digital objectives while reducing process risk.

Paragon’s inbound team currently processes over 35 million pages of inbound customer communications annually, across multiple document management facilities in the UK.

On a daily basis, Paragon’s nationwide sites process and digitise unstructured data such as complaint letters and ad-hoc notifications of change, as well as structured data like application forms, onboarding paperwork and account servicing documents.

These documents come via post, email, and remote location scanning, with in excess of 250,000 documents also arriving via fax machine each year – creating a growing challenge to process them quickly and efficiently to meet customer expectations.

Neil Murphy, VP at ABBYY, said: “We’re proud to be working with Paragon as they help banks, insurers, Government bodies and other critical businesses communicate better with customers when they need it most.

“All too often, manual processes and endless paperwork gets in the way of good quality customer communications. Automating this manual work with digital intelligence means staff can focus on business-critical tasks, leaving the paperwork to their ‘digital’ colleagues; digital intelligence holds immense value for businesses and the economy.”

Richard Machin, Director of Technology Services for Inbound Platforms at Paragon Customer Communications, said: “With the support of ABBYY and their digital intelligence solution, we will be able to grow our business at a time when good customer communications are more important than ever before.

“By using automation for the manual heavy-lifting, and using our people and their skills where they can have most impact, we can drive efficiency and value, which will ultimately help us onboard more clients. Thanks to ABBYY, our inbound business has the tools it needs to support growth, while still providing the best possible service to our clients.”
