## Can You Get Max on Your Apple TV?

 If you have a 4th-generation Apple TV or an Apple TV 4K (or later) that runs tvOS 13 or later (learn more about[tvOS versions)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tvos-4690282) , you can download the HBO Max app from the App Store. Note that the set-top box is different from the Apple TV app you might have on your smart TV or third-party  
  
 streaming device.

 Not sure which one you have? Consult[Apple’s support page to identify your Apple TV model](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101605) .

 If your Apple TV isn’t compatible, you can get HBO Max to your TV using AirPlay, Chromecast, or an HDMI cable to connect it to your computer, phone, or tablet. You can also get HBO Max on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku models, smart TVs, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles.

 Check the[Max device and platform compatibility page](https://help.max.com/us/Answer/Detail/000002506) for more details.
