## Master Hashtag Monitoring on Twitter with These Powerful Chat Utilities (Top 4 Picks)

Close 

[ X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-exactly-is-twitter-2483331) is one big chatroom for everyone in the world who's online, and a lot of people use it that way. The sheer volume of[ tweets](https://www.lifewire.com/best-time-of-day-to-tweet-3486090) makes it difficult to keep up with a particular group of people in one conversation, which is why it's useful to have X chat tools handy.

 With any one of these tools, you can’t go wrong. Getting involved in an[ X chat](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-participate-in-a-twitter-chat-4589083) is one of the best ways to attract new followers, be part of a community and learn new things. Best of all, it’s free and loads of fun.

## What's an X Chat Anyway? 

 Users across the globe host chats on different subjects at certain times and days of the week. Anyone with a public profile can participate by following the chat hashtag. For example, anybody interested in blogging can join the popular blog chat on X that takes place every Sunday evening, marked by the hashtag #blogchat.

 One of the biggest problems chat participants encounter is that following an active chat with lots of participants can be inefficient and frustrating when it's done on [ X via the web](https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-intro-to-using-twitter-2654622) or on one of the mobile apps. Some chats move so fast that tweets fly by before you get a chance to read them.

 You can use an X management tool like HootSuite to follow a specific hashtag in its own dedicated column, but chances are you’ll have the same problem as following via the X website. Everything moves too fast.

 If you’re serious about being involved with one or more X chats and don’t want to miss anything important, use tools specifically designed to follow X chats closely and interact with chatters easily. Here are a few tools to help you get started.

## X Pro 

 If you are into multitasking,[ X Pro](https://pro.twitter.com/) is the way to go. It creates multiple columns across the screen so you can monitor notifications, messages, activity and tweets, all at the same time. The columns are customizable, and you can change the defaults to include mentions, lists, messages, and other topics.

 To view a chat, you add the hashtag for the chat. Do this by adding a Search column and set the matching terms to the chat's hashtag. Then you have a column dedicated to the chat. You can set filters on the column to exclude retweets or to see tweets only in a specified language. You can also filter for a minimum number of likes and retweets.

 You can also send new tweets during a chat, add images, or schedule a tweet to go out at a specific time

## TwChat 

[ TwChat](http://twchat.com/) is great for people who are ready to take X chatting to the next level. This tool lets you sign in through your X account and create a profile so that you can then start your own chats, follow specific chatrooms, and bookmark hashtags for later. When you are in a chat room you can see all the new tweets, filter out retweets, highlight tweets that are questions, and send tweets to participate in the chat.

 Unlike some of the other chat tools, TwChat has two columns that separate the Mentors, who are the hosts of the chat and any special guests, from everybody else. On the front page, you can view a list of upcoming chats to see if any fit your interests.
