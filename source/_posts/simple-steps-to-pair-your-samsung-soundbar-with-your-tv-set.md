## How to Soft Reset a Samsung Soundbar

 To perform a soft reset on your soundbar means to reboot it. It may not seem like this can make any difference, but power cycling a soundbar in this way can resolve odd behavior or unexpected issues. Here's what to do:

1. Turn off your soundbar and disconnect it from power. Make sure the device is fully powered down.
2. Wait at least thirty seconds.
3. Plug the soundbar back in and turn it back on. Once it's powered back up, test it out and see if it's working.

## How to Hard Reset a Samsung Soundbar

 Hard resetting your soundbar involves completely resetting the device back to factory defaults. Although it sounds complicated, it really just involves a single button press.

 A hard reset will restore the software back to factory defaults. This means the soundbar will forget all its data, which includes paired devices. You'll need to re-add Bluetooth devices after the reset is finished.

1. Turn off the soundbar using its power button or the remote.
2. Hold down the power button on your soundbar for about 10 seconds.
3. Release the button when you see the message INT on the soundbar. If there's not a message, you might instead see a blinking red light.
4. Wait while the soundbar finishes up and prepares for first use.
