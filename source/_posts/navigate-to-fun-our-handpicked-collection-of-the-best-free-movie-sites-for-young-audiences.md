 What We Like

* Larger collection than other sites.
* No sign-up required.
* Pulls from other streaming services.

 What We Don't Like

* A lot of movies listed are not free to watch.
* Video quality is decent yet inconsistent.

 Yidio searches all the free movie websites and puts lists together so that all the movies are in one place, including free movies for kids. To view these titles, select**Genre** \>**Kids and Family** .

 Inside this movie section, you can sort by popularity and recently added selections, and filter the kids movies by rating such as G, PG, and PG-13.

 Some great free kids movies we've spotted here include _Escape From Planet Earth, Hoodwinked Too!, Spirit of the Forest, Cop Dog, The Snowman, Mia and the Migoo, Finding Rin Tin Tin, Lion of Oz_ , and_Soccer Mom._

 Tubi has a section for family movies and kids' shows, and even an entirely separate area of the site called Tubi Kids. Although you can't organize the films by rating or popularity, a single, full page of free kids' movies makes it easy to browse.

 What We Like

* No user account needed.
* All the kids titles are on one page.

 What We Don't Like

* Relatively few titles.
* Movies are mixed with TV shows.

 Sling Freestream is a section of the[ Sling TV](https://www.lifewire.com/sling-tv-4154536) service that includes just free movies and TV shows. We like it because you don't need to make an account, so you can jump right in and start watching free stuff immediately.

 Compared to other free movie sites, however, this one has an extremely small collection, which is why it's at the bottom of this list. There are three sections the movies are categorized in: Kids' Animation, Tweens, and Tiny Tots.

 Here are some examples of movies you can watch: _Two Buddies and a Badger, The Jungle Bunch, Blinky Bill: The Movie, Princess Emmy, Quackerz_ , and_A Monster In Paris_ .
