#### _Customers Derive Benefits from New Data Insights and Improved Operational Efficiencies_

  
Building on market demand from a partnership signed [late last year](https://www.blueprism.com/news/blue-prism-and-abbyy-partner-to-integrate-intelligent-optical-character-recognition-ocr-capabilities-with-enterprise-grade-robotic-process-automation-rpa "Blue Prism partnership news"), [Blue Prism (AIM: PRSM)](https://www.blueprism.com/investors "Blue Prism's investors"), the pioneer and market leader in Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and [ABBYY®](https://www.abbyy.com "ABBYY"), a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today announced dozens of new joint customers. Companies such as [ASB Bank](https://www.asb.co.nz/ "ASB Bank") and [Equinix](https://www.equinix.com/ "Equinix") are utilizing ABBYY’s FlexiCapture solution along with Blue Prism’s [connected-RPA platform](https://www.blueprism.com/news/blue-prism-drives-new-era-of-collaborative-innovation-and-intelligent-automation-with-connected-rpa "Blue Prism RPA news") to intelligently automate millions of transactions by turning unstructured content into structured and actionable data.

Both Blue Prism and ABBYY have been working closely to integrate their technologies as well as support a strong go-to-market strategy. ABBYY’s Chief Innovation Officer Anthony Macciola will participate in a panel discussion, with [Appian](https://www.appian.com/platform/robotic-process-automation-rpa/ "Appian") and [TrustPortal](https://www.trustportal.org/ "TrustPortal"), at Blue Prism World in London on April 4th at 1:20 pm to discuss, “putting intelligent automation skills to work”. At Blue Prism World, delegates will be able to learn more on how ABBYY’s content IQ technologies and solutions make it easy for enterprises to access, extract and validate data from disparate documents – including lending, invoices, applications, bills of lading, and more – and use it within business processes.

The integration with Blue Prism’s connected-RPA platform automates those processes at unprecedented speed – as well as giving enterprises better analysis of content for better performance, document process transparency, and contributing to improved customer experiences.

With this integration customers can easily automate and analyze content-centric processes involving images, documents, texts, and communications. Through this analysis users can learn from content to make more informed decisions. This integration enables organizations to dramatically increase the productivity of business processes, while lowering overall costs.

“Incorporating Robotic Process Automation with Intelligent Data Capture capabilities as part of your Digital Transformation Initiatives, drives transaction processing at unprecedented speed, shortening the procurement end to end cycle time,” says **Jaideep Vijayakar, Director of Finance Strategy and Transformation at Equinix.** “Working with WonderBotz, as our systems integrator, we were able to reduce our Supply Chain cycle by several days, easily extracting invoice data from regular pdfs and paper invoices, digitizing it and entering into our ERP system. Improving workflow efficiencies and accuracy, saves time and is allowing our Accounts Payable team to focus on better serving our vendors and partners."

“By working with ABBYY and Blue Prism, we’ve been able to drive new intelligent automation capabilities resulting in increased productivity, improved customer experiences and the delivery of new services,” says **Barry Coughlan, Head of Automation for ASB Bank**. “These new capabilities do more than improve operational efficiencies they give our workforce the agility to be more responsive to customer expectations.”
