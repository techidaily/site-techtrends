## Decoding the Variances: Home Theatre Systems vs Traditional Stereo Receivers Explained
 When you set up a home sound system, you need a receiver. These devices play a crucial role in determining the quality of sound you'll experience. In considering receivers, there are two major possibilities, and these determine how you use your sound system. We compared the differences and similarities between home theater receivers and stereo receivers to help you decide which fits into your home entertainment system.

## Overall Findings

 Home Theater

* Five or more channels.
* Full surround sound support.
* Compatible with various video inputs.
* Multiple configurations are possible.

 Stereo

* Geared toward music.
* Better sound quality.
* Designed for high-fidelity audio inputs.
* Simpler to set up.

 A home theater receiver (also called an AV receiver or surround sound receiver) is optimized to be the central connection and control hub for the audio and video needs of a home theater system. A stereo receiver is optimized to serve as the control and connection hub for an audio-only listening experience.

 That doesn't mean these receivers can't be used interchangeably in a pinch. You hear better sound out of a mismatched receiver than you hear with a TV's built-in speaker or a direct connection to a phone's audio jack.

 As you look into receivers for your system, consider how you plan to use it most and which type of applications are important to you.

 Both have some core features in common. However, there are features on a home theater receiver that aren't found in a stereo receiver and vice versa.

### Optional Home Theater Receiver Features

 Optional features that may be included on many home theater receivers (at the discretion of the manufacturer):

* Additional amplifiers to accommodate 7.1, 9.1, 11.1, or 13.1 channel configurations.
* A[second subwoofer preamp output](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-two-or-more-subwoofers-1846819) .
* Built-in audio decoding for one, or more, immersive surround sound formats, such as[Dolby Atmos](https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-atmos-cinema-to-home-theater-1847278) ,[DTS:X](https://www.lifewire.com/dts-x-surround-sound-format-1847004) , and[Auro 3D Audio](http://www.auro-3d.com/consumer/experience) .
* Automatic speaker setup system, such as AccuEQ (Onkyo), Anthem Room Correction (Anthem AV), Audyssey (Denon/Marantz), MCACC (Pioneer), and YPAO (Yamaha). These systems place a provided microphone at the listening position and plug it into a home theater receiver. The receiver sends test tones to each speaker, which are picked up by the microphone. The speaker setup program calculates the size of the speakers and the distance from the listening position. It then calculates the crossover (the point where lower frequencies are sent to the subwoofer and mid and high frequencies are sent to the rest of the speakers) and channel level adjustments.
* [Multi-zone connection and control](https://www.lifewire.com/home-theater-receivers-and-the-multi-zone-feature-1846247) operates two or more audio or audio/video systems in other rooms via direct amplification or the use of external amplifiers.
* [Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546) and[Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) connectivity create a connection to a home network router to stream from the internet and access media files on PCs and other compatible devices.
* Internet streaming provides access to[internet radio, and additional internet-based music streaming services](https://www.lifewire.com/top-places-to-listen-to-free-music-online-1356649) .
* Wireless multi-room audio gives some home theater receivers the ability to send select audio sources to wireless speakers placed in other rooms.

 Examples of multi-room audio platforms include[MusicCast (Yamaha)](https://www.lifewire.com/yamahas-musiccast-whole-house-audio-1847271) ,[PlayFi (Anthem, Integra, Pioneer)](https://www.lifewire.com/dts-play-fi-4155587) , and[HEOS (Denon/Marantz)](https://www.lifewire.com/heos-4155588) .

* Some home theater receivers may provide for direct streaming from[Bluetooth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bluetooth-2377412) and[AirPlay](https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-airplay-work-and-what-devices-can-use-it-2438219) devices.
* One or two USB ports are sometimes included. This allows access to music content from USB connectable devices, such as flash drives.
* All home theater receivers can pass-through video signals from a connected source to a TV or video projector. Many provide additional video processing and[upscaling](https://www.lifewire.com/video-upscaling-the-basics-1846952) capability, including setting adjustments or calibration modes.
* Voice control of music streaming, music playback, and select setting functions using[Alexa](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107) or[Google Assistant](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911) .

## Stereo Receiver: A More Musical Experience

 Advantages

* Designed for music.
* Focus on two channels to match stereo music recordings.
* Attention to top audio quality.
* Simple configuration for easy music connectivity.

 Disadvantages

* Limited to two channels.
* Limited connectivity for video inputs.

 You might not need the capabilities of a home theater receiver if you only want to listen to music. In that case, a[stereo receiver](https://www.lifewire.com/best-stereo-receivers-3135075) may be the best option for you (and favored by many serious music listeners).

 The core features of a stereo receiver differ from a home theater receiver in two ways. A stereo receiver typically has only two built-in amplifiers, which provide a two-channel speaker configuration (left and right). Surround sound decoding or processing isn't provided. A stereo receiver may only have analog audio connections.

### Optional Stereo Receiver Features

 Just as home theater receivers, there are additional options stereo receivers may have at the manufacturer's discretion. Some added features are the same as those for home theater receivers.

[A/B speaker connections](https://www.lifewire.com/benefits-of-adding-speakers-using-b-switch-3134657) connect up to four speakers but don't result in a surround sound listening experience. The B speakers mirror the main speakers and draw power from the same two amplifiers. This means that half the power goes to each speaker.

 The A/B speaker option is useful when listening to the same audio source in a second room or when you need more coverage in a large room.

[Zone 2 operation via preamp outputs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zone-2-1846858) may be provided but requires a connection to external amplifiers.

 Unlike the A/B speaker configuration, if a Zone 2 option is included, different audio sources can be sent to the main and remote stereo system setups.

 Select stereo receivers are advertised as four-channel receivers. While these receivers have four built-in amplifiers, the third and fourth channels are mirrors of the main left and right channel amplifiers. This feature is practical in that it powers speakers in another location without splitting the power from the two main amplifiers, as would be the case when using an A/B switch or connecting an external amplifier, as is the case with a Zone 2 function.

 A four-channel stereo receiver may or may not be able to send different sources to each set of speakers.

 Select stereo receivers provide a subwoofer preamp output. This allows the use of compact main speakers, combined with a subwoofer, to reproduce the extreme low frequencies.

This type of configuration is referred to as a 2.1 channel setup.

 Most stereo receivers provide a headphone connection for private listening.

 Although removed from many stereo receivers after CDs were introduced, the inclusion of a dedicated phono/turntable input connection is making a comeback due to the revival of vinyl record playback popularity.

 Digital optical and digital coaxial audio inputs provide audio connection flexibility for CD players, DVD players, Blu-ray Disc players, media streamers, and cable and satellite boxes.

 Unlike a home theater receiver, digital coaxial and optical connections on stereo receivers can't pass Dolby Digital or DTS surround sound format signals. When included in a stereo receiver, these connections only pass two-channel PCM audio signals.

 Just as wireless multiroom audio is an added feature on some home theater receivers, there are a limited number of stereo receivers that provide this option. One example is the MusicCast platform available on some Yamaha Stereo Receivers.

 Some stereo receivers include Ethernet and Wi-Fi connectivity to access music streaming services and local network devices. Bluetooth for direct music streaming from compatible smartphones and tablets may also be provided. In addition, USB connectivity for music content that's stored on a flash drive may be included.

 Although stereo receivers are designed for music listening, some provide video connectivity for convenience. You may find a stereo receiver that provides analog (composite) or HDMI connectivity, although this is rare. On these stereo receivers, the video connections are provided for pass-through convenience only.

 A stereo receiver doesn't provide video processing or upscaling capability. Any audio passed to an HDMI-equipped stereo receiver is limited to[two-channel PCM](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-pcm-1846928) .

## Final Verdict

 Home theater and stereo receivers make great hubs for a home entertainment experience, but each serves a different role. However, that doesn't mean you have to buy both to fulfill your needs.

 Even though a home theater receiver is optimized for surround sound and video, it can also operate in a two-channel stereo mode. This allows for traditional music-only listening.

 When a home theater receiver operates in a two-channel stereo mode, only the front left and right speakers (and perhaps the subwoofer) are active.

 If you want an audio-only system for serious music listening (or a hub for a second room), and don't need the video extras a home theater receiver offers, a stereo receiver and a good pair of loudspeakers may be just the ticket.

 Not all home theater or stereo receivers have the same combination of features. Depending on the brand and model, there may be a different feature mix. When shopping, check the feature listing of the home theater or stereo receiver and get a listening demo, if possible, before making a buying decision.
