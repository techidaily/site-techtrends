## The Lineup of iPad Models that Boast Onboard Satellite Positioning Tools

 iPads with GPS can be used for navigation and other location-aware apps. However, you need the right model to take full advantage of its GPS features. Not all models have built-in GPS.

## Which iPad Models Have Built-In GPS?

 A built-in GPS chip is found in Apple's Wi-Fi + Cellular iPad models, which is an option for all available versions of the tablet. These devices cost more than the Wi-Fi-only versions.

 Apple never stated why it doesn't include a GPS chip in the Wi-Fi-only models. It might be because many apps that use GPS for navigation and other duties draw on data from the internet, even when you're out of range of a Wi-Fi signal. This means GPS apps are effectively broken when out of Wi-Fi range on a Wi-Fi-only iPad.

 You don't need to pay for a data plan for the GPS chip to work. If you get a Wi-Fi + Cellular model with no data plan, you won't receive fresh maps, points of interest, and other related data when out of Wi-Fi range.

## Wi-Fi-Only iPads Can Still Track Your Location

 Confusing the issue somewhat is that a Wi-Fi-only iPad can fairly accurately pinpoint your location under many conditions. As long as it can pick up a few Wi-Fi signals, it can use[Wi-Fi positioning](https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-positioning-system-1683343) , which draws on a database of known Wi-Fi hotspots, to determine where you are located.

## Best Built-in and Downloadable Apps for GPS and Navigation

 The iPad comes with a[Maps app](https://www.lifewire.com/use-apple-maps-app-1999196) that lets you search for addresses, points of interest, and more. After finding a location, you can get turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic information.

 Several other key apps included with the iPad make good use of the tablet's location-finding capability. The Photos app automatically geotags your photos and videos (you can turn off this feature) to help you organize and find photos by location. The Reminders app lets you geofence and set reminders by location.

 With its large, high-resolution Retina display, the iPad is popular with pilots and boaters. Pilots use apps for charts, weather, and airport information. Sailors can tap into a wealth of charting and navigation apps.

 In some cases,[GPS apps built for the iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-gps-navigation-apps-1683498) are also compatible with iPad. Travelers appreciate apps like[Flight Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/app/the-flight-tracker/id533365777) , a live flight status tracker. There's also[Tripit: Travel Planner](https://apps.apple.com/app/tripit-travel-planner/id311035142) ,[Kayak](https://apps.apple.com/app/kayak-flights-hotels-cars/id305204535) , and[Yelp](https://apps.apple.com/app/yelp-food-delivery-services/id284910350) for restaurant and other reviews. Outdoors enthusiasts can enjoy apps such as[Maps 3D PRO](https://apps.apple.com/app/maps-3d-pro-hike-bike/id391304000) .
