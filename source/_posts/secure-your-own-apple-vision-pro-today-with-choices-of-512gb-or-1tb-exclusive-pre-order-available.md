## Secure Your Own Apple Vision Pro Today with Choices of 512GB or 1TB - Exclusive Pre-Order Available !

Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset is [officially available for pre-orders](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-vision-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and power users (who are willing to spend) are in for a treat. Beyond the base storage of 256GB, which many critics had been wary about due to the sheer [volume of content consumable](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-now-marketing-vision-pro-as-the-ultimate-entertainment-device/) on the headset, Apple will be offering the Vision Pro in 512GB and 1TB options.

[Buy the Apple Vision Pro View now at Apple](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-vision-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

The 512GB configuration will run you $3,699, a $200 price bump from the base level, while the 1TB option will cost $3,899\. From the big picture, that's only a little more than what Apple typically charges for storage upgrades, with $100 increments for iPhones and $200 increments for MacBooks.

Beyond storage size, interested buyers will also have to factor in the price of Zeiss Optical Inserts (readers or prescriptions), which Apple is charging between $99 to $149 for, AppleCare+ for $499 or $24.99 per month, and any [additional accessories](https://www.zdnet.com/article/first-look-at-apple-vision-pros-199-travel-case-and-it-looks-very-well-made/). In the end, you can expect to pay as much as $4,500 for the highest-configured Vision Pro.

While that's not as crazy as a fully provisioned, [$52,000 Mac Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-apples-52599-mac-pro-overpriced/), it's still a lot to spend on a consumer product. But you probably knew that already going into this.
