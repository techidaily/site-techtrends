#### _Partnership to provide powerful integrated advance capture solutions available through resellers_ 

ABBYY®, an intelligent automation company, and Transalis, the UKs number one provider of B2B Digital Integration Managed Services, today announced a strategic alliance to help organizations unlock the value of information to realize the true benefits of Integration Brokerage – connecting multiple, disparate data sources for one single view of assets.

As enterprise information continues to grow, with processes becoming outdated and operating models becoming increasingly strained, organizations are struggling to know where to begin with the journey to the digital enterprise. Organizations continue to look to new technology to streamline their operations.

Together, ABBYY and Transalis will help customers navigate the digital landscape by transforming paper to digital information, the core building block, as well as accessing and sharing information on demand, to understanding and acting upon information in real-time to drive competitive advantage.

“_Data is the abundant new raw material, but knowledge is the final product_”, says Jonathan Darbey, product group head data capture at ABBYY. “_The challenge is everything in between and how to go from one state to the other. Our joint belief is that data is step one, information is step two and knowledge is step three – each phase adding incremental capabilities in order to enable the end goal – step four – action_”.

The joint effort of the companies will bridge the gap between machine and human language, so that enterprise applications and services become more natural, more personal and more valuable.

“_ABBYY solutions and technologies provide key components for accessing and analyzing information,_” says Adam Swanson, Transalis sales director. “_Combining them with Transalis cloud solutions such as OpenEDI, DataCapture and YourAnalytics, our customers can not only process information from all of their documents within one IT solutions suite, but also tackle the challenge of understanding unstructured content from big data and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios._”

This new partnership opens up the ability to automate highly repetitive business tasks such as invoice data capture. Business-critical information can be captured from various document formats – including images and scans – and can then be transferred back-to-back with EDI generated data into customers’ information systems, workflows and processes. For the first time, all data, structured and unstructured can be used for Supply Chain decision-making, in real-time.
