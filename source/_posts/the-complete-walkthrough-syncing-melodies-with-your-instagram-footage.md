1. Open the Instagram app and tap the**Your story** icon in the top-left corner to create a new Story.
2. Take a new photo or choose a photo or video from your gallery.
3. Tap the**Music** icon.  
 You can also tap**Stickers** \>**Music** to open the same music library. The Stickers icon is the one that looks like a smiley face post-it note.

5. Tap**15** and choose the length of the track for your Story and tap**Done** .  
 Track length is limited due to copyright restrictions. Instagram Stories are typically less than 15 seconds anyway so this limitation shouldn’t be an issue for many.

7. Tap the**Music** sticker to choose a different display style or hide the information altogether.
