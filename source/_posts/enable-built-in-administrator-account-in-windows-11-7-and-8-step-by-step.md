## Quick & Simple Steps to Rejuvenate Windows 11 Without a Hitch

Different from previous operating system, reinstall in Windows 10 can be divided to two different things: **refresh** Windows 10 and **reset**  Windows 10\. Please choose accordingly whether refresh or reset is more appropriate to your situation.

 A**refresh on Windows 10** will help you reinstall Windows 10\. However, it will**remove** the applications and drivers that you have installed and your personal settings will be changed back to default as well. It will also remove applications from your computer manufacturer but the apps you installed from the Windows store will remain. This is what this post is about: we are doing a reinstall by performing a**refresh** .

 A**reset on Windows 10** will help you reinstall Windows 10 and removes**ALL** your personal files. The drivers, the applications, the personal changes that you made to settings, and the applications installed by your computer manufacturer will be removed as well. However, if your computer came with Windows 10, apps from your computer manufacturer will be reinstalled. Therefore, we**strongly** recommend that you**back up** your important personal files and applications first.
