## Enhancing Gameplay Storage: Setting Up Your External HDD with Xbox One

Close 

 On Xbox One, you can't swap the built-in hard drive for a new one, but you_can_ do something even better: use an additional[ external hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-external-drive-2625867) . This article explains the requirements and how to do it.

##  Requirements for Adding an HDD to Your Xbox One 

 When you add a hard drive to your Xbox One, you get to use the 500GB internal drive, plus up to two additional external USB HDDs with as many terabytes of storage as you can afford to hold all of your games.

 You have a wide range of options for external HDDs on the Xbox One. You can use any HDD that is:

1. USB 3.0
2. At least 256GB and
3. At least 5400rpm.

 From there, any brand and any size will work. Faster read speeds and higher capacity cost more, of course. Solid-state drives can offer the best performance but cost more. You can get a decent 5400rpm 1TB external USB 3.0 HDD for around $60.

##  How to Use an External HDD with Xbox One 

 Using an external HDD is surprisingly simple. They are USB-powered, so no need to plug them into an A/C outlet or anything. 

 Just plug the USB cable into the USB port on the back of your Xbox One, and you're good to go. 

 The drive will need to be formatted before you can use it but the Xbox ONE will do that for you; just let the fast process unfold and then start playing.

 The drives are usually very small, so just tuck them somewhere out of the way (but try to give them plenty of ventilation as they can get hot).

##  How HDDs Improve Performance 

 Here is something interesting about using an external HDD on Xbox One: It can actually load games faster than the internal drive because it can transfer data more quickly. 

 The same 5400rpm speed that the internal drive uses will actually load games a little faster from an external drive. 

 Opt for a 7200rpm external drive or a solid-state drive, and games can load even quicker. We're talking_many_ seconds of faster load times.

##  Do You Really Need an External HDD? 

 While there are definite benefits to using an external HDD with your Xbox One, don't misunderstand and think it is a necessity or requirement or anything. Consider which games you're going to be playing, and how many, and decide from there if you need an external drive.

 We never would have made it through the first two years of the Xbox One's life without an external drive, but most people aren't going to be playing dozens of games in just a few months. 

 Still, you may fill up the internal HDD just with[ Game Pass](https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-game-pass-4178809) titles after a while, so looking into an external HDD isn't a bad idea.

## Bottom Line 

 You can certainly get by with the 500GB internal drive by[ deleting old games](https://www.lifewire.com/uninstall-xbox-one-game-4156788) and reinstalling them when you want to play them, but if you have to redownload large games, it can be a real pain depending on your Internet speed. An external drive can save you time and trouble.
