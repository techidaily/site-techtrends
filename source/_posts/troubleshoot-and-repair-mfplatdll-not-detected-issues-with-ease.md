## Troubleshoot & Solve Your Computer’s d3dx9_40.dll Absence Issues Easily
 Any of Microsoft's operating systems since Windows 98 might be affected by d3dx9\_40.dll and other DirectX problems. This includes Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.  

## How to Fix D3dx9\_40.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download d3dx9\_40.dll individually from any "DLL download site." It's usually[not recommended to download a DLL file like that](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, remove it immediately from wherever you put it and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The d3dx9\_40.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, this will fix the "d3dx9\_40.dll not found" error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.  
 Usually, if a game or​ another program uses DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc. For example, if you're using the game with[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) , it's probably called_DXSETUP.exe_ , and can be found in a_redist_ folder in the game's installation directory. If you can't find it manually, try searching your entire computer for "dxsetup.exe" using a file search tool like[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) .  
 Another example is the GB-ASManager program. When the DLL error is seen there, reinstall the software included on the associated DVD.
4. [Uninstall and then reinstall the game or software program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_40.dll, and a reinstallation could do the trick.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_40.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) from the latest DirectX package. If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your d3dx9\_40.dll error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for your video card. While it's not the most common solution, in some situations, updating the video card[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

## Causes of D3dx9\_40.dll Errors

 D3dx9\_40.dll problems source from an error with Microsoft DirectX. This[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) is one of many contained in the DirectX software collection. Since the software is used by games and advanced graphics programs, d3dx9\_40.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

![D3dx9_40.dll was not found error message](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zMqQY5ObeMnp6iyfF2ck8DG5wpQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/d3dx9_40-dll-error-message-7d07ae81cc6b41dbb87c2d4080d74c83.png)

 There are several ways d3dx9\_40.dll errors can reveal themselves on your computer. Here are several of the more common messages you might see:

* **D3DX9\_40.DLL Not Found**
* **The file d3dx9\_40.dll is missing**
* **File d3dx9\_40.dll not found**
* **The program can't start because d3dx9\_40.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.**
* **D3dx9\_40.dll not found. Reinstalling might help fix this.**
* **The code execution cannot proceed because d3dx9\_40.dll was not found.**
* **Your system appears to be missing D3DX9\_40.dll**

 The error message could apply to any program that uses Microsoft DirectX, but it's most commonly seen in video games, including_Need for Speed_ ,_Gothic_ ,_Total War_ , and_Psychonauts_ .
