## Uncover Past Costs of Amazon Items: Methods and Insights

### Key Takeaways

* Go to camelcamelcamel.com and paste the address for an Amazon product into the search bar to view its entire price history.
* Make use of the "Good Deal" and "Best Price" markers to identify deals.
* For quicker access to price histories and alerts, install the Camelizer browser extension.

 Prices on Amazon change constantly. Knowing the price history can give you an edge in finding good deals. It'll also help you see through the deception when a deal isn't really a deal. So how do you track those prices without manually checking the page every day?

##  View Amazon Price Changes with Camelcamelcamel

 Whether it's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, [Prime Day](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-still-using-pattern-locks-with-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/), or another sale, one great tool for finding Amazon price histories is the website [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/). The helpful site lets you track the sales and price drops of any product over the course of its existence on Amazon. All you have to do is copy and paste the listing's URL into camelcamelcamel's search bar and hit Enter.

![Paste an Amazon URL into Camelcamelcamel's search bar](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/camelcamelcamel-website-searchbar.png) 

 When you bring up a price history page, you'll see a chart tracking the price across time. Use the chart settings to adjust the duration shown, add and compare third-party prices, or remove the most extreme price changes.

 As you can see in the chart above, whenever Amazon is out of stock of this [AMD 5900X](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5900X-24-Thread-Processor/dp/B08164VTWH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209616&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F734836%2Fhow-to-see-amazon-price-histories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) (where the green line becomes dotted), third-party sellers often appear with prices far above Amazon's price, even when the units are used. This is especially evident at the beginning of the chart, shortly after the CPU's release, when it was constantly out of stock.

 Camelcamelcamel does not and cannot factor the cost of shipping and handling into the prices shown. The website will, however, let you know if the product qualifies for [Prime shipping](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/).

 To help you shop, camelcamelcamel designates "Good Deal" and "Best Price" conditions for each listing based on its price history. If the price currently meets one of those conditions, you'll see it noted at the top of the price history page. If you're on the [hunt for a great deal](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-virtual-meetups-made-simple-setting-up-video-calls-with-whatsapp-on-your-laptop/), you can click "Popular Products" and "Top Price Drops" to see lists of products that currently meet those conditions.

![The CPU is a good deal at 299.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-good-deal.png) 

 If you're hungry for more data, you can scroll below the price graph to see tables with the highest, lowest, and most average prices. These data points can help you judge for yourself what constitutes a good price.

 Of course, you probably don't want to keep checking the site over and over again for price drops. Fortunately, camelcamelcamel can monitor that for you and let you know when a sale or price drop happens.

 Above the price chart for any item, there's a simple form where you can [set up price alerts](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-vivo-x100-pro-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). You can then get notifications via email when the price drops below your specified price. The feature is especially helpful if you're thinking of buying a product but suspect that the price might drop in the future.

##  Using the Camelizer Browser Extension

 Many of Camelcamelcamel's capabilities are available in a browser add-on called [the Camelizer](https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer). You can get it on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Safari, and Opera.

 Any time you're viewing a product on Amazon, you can click the Camelizer button on your browser's toolbar to instantly see the price history. You can also sign up for price drop alerts directly in the extension window.
