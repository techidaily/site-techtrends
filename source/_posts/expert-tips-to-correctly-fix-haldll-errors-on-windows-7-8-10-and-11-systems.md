## Expert Tips to Correctly Fix Hal.dll Errors on Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 Systems
 As it would seem, an issue with the hal.dll file might be the root cause of the error, for instance, if the file has been corrupted or deleted. Another possible cause is a damaged hard drive, but in most cases that we've seen, missing hal.dll errors are due to issues with the primary boot code.  

 When these error messages are seen in[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , they're usually caused by different issues than in later versions of Windows. See[How to Fix Hal.dll Errors in Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-missing-hal-dll-errors-in-windows-xp-2623695) instead.

## How to Fix Hal.dll Errors in Windows 11, 10, 8, 7 & Vista

 This issue applies to all editions of[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , and[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , including both[32-bit and 64-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) versions of these operating systems.

1. Restart your computer. While not very likely, the hal.dll error could be caused by a temporary problem that a reboot might take care of. It's worth a try.  
[Why Does Restarting Fix Many Computer Problems?](https://www.lifewire.com/why-does-restarting-seem-to-fix-most-computer-problems-2624569)  
 Since hal.dll errors appear before Windows has completely started, you probably won't be able to[properly restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . Unfortunately, you'll need to force a restart instead, which you can do by pressing or holding down the physical power button.
2. [Check the boot sequence in BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-in-bios-2624528) . If the[BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-basic-input-output-system-2625820) is configured so the[boot order](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-boot-sequence-2625814) first lists a hard drive other than the one with your usually used copy of Windows installed on it, that might be the problem.  
 If you've recently installed an internal hard drive, plugged in an external hard drive, made changes in BIOS, or[flashed your BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-bios-4783238) , be sure you give proper weight to this possibility!
3. [Perform a Startup Repair](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . Windows startup fix-it tools will often fix hal.dll issues caused by corruption of the DLL file itself.
4. [Update the volume boot code to use BOOTMGR](https://www.lifewire.com/use-bootsect-nt60-to-update-the-volume-boot-code-to-bootmgr-2617975) . If the[volume boot code](https://www.lifewire.com/volume-boot-code-2626044) has corrupted or is configured for a boot manager other than[BOOTMGR](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-boot-manager-bootmgr-2625813) then you might see a hal.dll is missing error.  
 An issue with the volume boot code is the most common cause of hal.dll errors in Windows 7â€”11\. The reason we list it as the fourth troubleshooting step is because the first three are so simple to try. However, if you're comfortable working with advanced tools on Windows, feel free to give this one a shot first.
5. [Test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . It's possible at this point that the problem could be[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) related.  
[Replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) if the test you run on your hard drive fails, and then install Windows again on the new drive (see Step 6).
6. [Complete a clean install of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This kind of Windows install method completely erases everything on your hard drive and installs a new copy of Windows.  
 A clean install will fix any software-based (corruption, etc.) cause of any hal.dll error you're seeing, but it's something you should only do if you're sure your hard drive is physically working properly and you've tried all other software troubleshooting.  
 As of January 2020, Microsoft is[no longer supporting Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-end-of-life-4161085) . We recommend[upgrading to Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-7-to-windows-10-4770091) or Windows 11 to continue receiving security updates and technical support.
