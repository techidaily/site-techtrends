## Modernizing the Papacy? Understanding Pope Francis's Approach to Using Email
 Although His Holiness Pope Francis might have a private or official email address, he does maintain a publicly listed email address. People who wish to contact him by modern means aren't relegated to snail mail as he has an active[social media feed](https://twitter.com/Pontifex) .

## Contact the Pope Through the Mail

 For contacting Pope Francis through the postal service, the Vatican provides this address:

 **His Holiness, Pope Francis**
 **Apostolic Palace**
 **00120 Vatican City**

 Don't add "Italy" to the address. The Vatican is a separate political entity from Italy.

## The Pope Doesn't Use Email

 Despite his lack of email accessibility, Pope Francis sees modern communication options as beneficial. When[Tim Cook, Apple's CEO](https://www.lifewire.com/who-is-tim-cook-1994301) , visited the Vatican in January 2016, Pope Francis released a message titled   _Communication and Mercy: A Fruitful Encounter, for the 50th World Day of Social Communications_ . In it, he said that the internet, text messages, and social networks are "gifts from God."

## Other Popes in the Information Age

 Unlike their current successor, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II had email addresses: <benedictxvi@vatican.va> and john\_paul\_ii@vatican.va, respectively. Both might have had other private email addresses inside the Vatican, as well.

 Karol Józef Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II in 1978 before people used email widely and practically. The[first email](https://www.lifewire.com/first-email-message-1164184) had been written seven years previous to his ascendancy, but few people outside the computer programming field knew computer networks existed. Yet, John Paul II became the first email-savvy pontiff in history and the first to be canonized in centuries.

 In late 2001, the pope [apologized for injustices committed by the Roman Catholic Church in Oceania via email](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1671540.stm) . The Holy Father would have preferred to visit the Pacific nations and deliver his words of penitence in person, but email made for an effective second-best choice.
