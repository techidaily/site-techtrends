### Download Older AMD/ATI Graphics Card Drivers

 Desktop and Mobility Radeon HD 4000, HD 3000, HD 2000 drivers, as well as Radeon HD AGP series drivers, tend to be released less often and are usually focused on fixing problems. You can download the latest drivers available for these GPUs from the[AMD Drivers and Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html) . Beta drivers and drivers for other AMD products can also be found there.

 AMD supports Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP, but not always with the latest driver version. Check the[AMD Drivers and Software](https://www.amd.com/en/support) page for Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP drivers for your AMD-based video card.
