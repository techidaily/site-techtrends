## Discover the Ultimate List: 12 Movie Streamers That Won't Cost a Dime
 This list of movie apps will give you access to thousands of[free streaming movies](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-free-movies-online-1356647) right at your fingertips. I've used more apps than the ones listed below, but these are my favorites for various reasons. You can watch comedies, family films, action movies, documentaries, and many other types of movies. There really is something for everyone!  

[Free TV Streaming: 10 Ways to Watch TV Shows Online Free in 2024](https://www.lifewire.com/sites-to-watch-free-tv-shows-online-3486367)

 What We Like

* YouTube-provided list of free movies.
* Films are organized into genre sections.
* No ads for Premium subscribers.

 What We Don't Like

* Can't sort the free movies by popularity, year, or date added.
* Search tool includes paid movies.

[Our Favorite Free Movies on YouTube (August 2024)](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-movies-on-youtube-5114491)

 YouTube has an awesome collection of totally free movies. The company actually puts together its own list, so you don't have to go searching through random people's profiles to find full-length films that are legal to watch.

 It's super easy to find the better free movies on YouTube by simply opening the[Movies & TV page](https://www.youtube.com/feed/storefront?bp=ogUCKAY%3D) . All the regular genres are included, so you can browse films marked as action, horror, science fiction, drama, comedy, etc. There's also an_Independent_ section.  

 As you'd expect, you can stream YouTube movies on all the best smartphones and devices, such as iOS and Android mobile devices, Android TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku.

**Download For** :

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube)

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664)

 There are also some channels dedicated to no-cost films, like[Maverick Movies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDySQNnzfMCqoBxquMEhCOi0GUEB1RbCf) and[Timeless Classic Movies](https://www.youtube.com/user/TimelessClassicMovie/videos) .

## [Tubi](https://www.lifewire.com/free-online-tubi-tv-1357455)

![Tubi free movie app for Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mcGsR0WxKnMuBdiclgNvCjrVCpU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/movies-tubi-app-865ec1767bb142859726ed3612efec06.png)

 What We Like

* Movies are in their own list, separate from shows.
* High quality films.
* Provides trailers.
* Identifies when a movie is about to go away.
* Includes a kids category and live TV.

 What We Don't Like

* Can't sort the genre lists.

 This app looks almost identical to[Tubi's website](https://tubitv.com/home) , but it's optimized so well for mobile that it's super easy to use. All the same genres and the search tool are available through the app, and every movie cover is large enough to see without having to tap on them. There are tens of thousands of movies and shows to pick from here.

 Choosing a movie will take you to its description page where it shows the release date, duration, genre, and similar titles you might like. "Like" or "dislike" a movie to teach the app what it should recommend to you in the future.

 One reason I've ranked Tubi as one of the best apps for free movies is because of its awesome curated collections, such as_Cult Classics_ ,_Only Free on Tubi,_ and_Highly Rated on Rotten Tomatoes_ . An added bonus is that you can start watching immediately without needing a user account.

 Tubi works from not only phones and tablets, but also streaming devices and smart TVs.

 What We Like

* Lots of high quality movies.
* Clearly differentiates free from paid.
* Adds new titles often.
* Organize favorites in custom lists.
* Parental control options.

 What We Don't Like

* Free movies are often removed.
* Must log in.

 This one is well known for movies you can buy, but if you're fine with the occasional ad, you can stream thousands of free movies at Fandango at Home, too, including their trailers.

 Viewing only the free options is easy; just open the **Free** page from the menu or browse for films that have the **FREE WITH ADS**  label. From there, you can look through all the films by the ones that are new this week, are the most popular, or are in specific genres.

 Something else you can do is[see all of Fandango at Home's free movies](https://www.vudu.com/content/movies/free) on their website and then search for a specific film on the app to watch it from your mobile device.

 Other helpful ways I like to find something to stream is through curated lists like_Top 200_ , _Hidden Gems, All-Time Movie Favorites, Captivating Dramas, LOL Comedies_ ,_Blast From the Past, Disaster Strikes_ , and_Aliens and Outer Space._

 I've watched Fandango at Home films through the Android, iPhone, and iPad apps, as well as through Roku and Chromecast. It also runs on Apple TV.

## [Prime Video (Freevee)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/splash/getTheApp?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1357452%7Cne78f4c9980784fb9b8eeb3f76aa15ffd02%7C)

 What We Like

* Properly separates movies from TV shows.
* Every category list can be filtered for relevant browsing.
* Includes trailers.
* App-wide search includes free filter toggle.

 What We Don't Like

* Must have an Amazon account.

 It might not seem like[Amazon Prime Video](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363) belongs in this list, but there's actually an entire section of the app that lists only the movies and shows Amazon lets you watch absolutely free. This service is called[Freevee](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-amazon-freevee-7557868) .

 Something I especially like is how these films are organized. There are the typical categories for helping you find popular and recently added movies, plus genre-specific lists for comedies, dramas, etc. But within each list, you can further refine the results by subtitle language and genre.

 I've also seen useful collections like_Movies of the month_ and_Freevee Originals_ .

 Like most movie apps, Freevee is also available in a web browser and as a TV app.

 The links below are for the Prime Video app, but there's also a[dedicated Freevee app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/splash/freevee%5Ffindus?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1357452%7Cne78f4c9980784fb9b8eeb3f76aa15ffd02%7C) . I prefer Prime Video because it has better sorting options, but the Freevee app is good if you don't want to see rent/buy options.

## [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/)

![A list of free movies in the Plex Android app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/p3PWx2oWZ7ytRoLSR7mGT4LKL7M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/plex-movie-app-e5d865cddfb04296bfaeae5281888deb.png)

 What We Like

* Saves progress so you can resume later.
* Add titles to a watchlist.
* Browse by actor, and other ways to locate movies.
* Includes trailers and live TV.

 What We Don't Like

* Rentals are mixed in.
* Doesn't separate movies from shows.
* No filtering or sorting options.
* Extras cost, like Skip Intro and mobile downloads.

 Plex is a unique app. It offers free movie and TV streaming like these other apps, but it can also connect to your computer to[access your own media files from anywhere](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-plex-4175459) .

 All the typical genres are included, including one for just description audio titles. Plex also puts movies into unique categories like_Based on a True Story_ and_Women Making History._ I also like the_Leaving Soon_ section which lets me catch movies before they start to cost elsewhere.

 You can also get alerts when watchlisted items are available to stream, see similar movies to the one you're interested in, watch movies with friends remotely, scroll through titles coming soon, and view movies that are available in your other streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.).

 This app feels a bit cluttered because of all the stuff you can do in it. But after even a few minutes, you'll quickly find your way around. The free movies are easy to find if that's all you're interested in.

**Download For** :

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android)

 What We Like

* Adds new movies regularly.
* Interesting genres to pick from.
* No user account necessary.
* Includes movie trailers.
* The ads support the filmmakers.

 What We Don't Like

* Can't sort any genre list.
* Occasional streaming problems.

 Filmzie is built for independent filmmakers and small studios. It's my go-to when I'm looking for something totally new.  

 The typical genres are available, like most apps, but I love the unique ways Filmzie organizes its films. Some examples include_Directed by Women, Top Rated on IMDb, Cuddle-Up Comedies,_ and_Undiscovered Gems._

 The app is simple to use, it has a really smooth interface, and you don't even need to make a user account to start streaming. It runs on Android and iOS.

 What We Like

* Watch movies while they're playing live on TV.
* Has on-demand movies that you can watch over and over.
* Works on lots of devices.

 What We Don't Like

* Has non-movie channels; can be overwhelming if you only want movies.
* Can't re-watch a film unless it's on demand.
* Only a handful of movie channels.

 I like to open Pluto TV for free movies when I don't know what to watch. Because it works like cable TV, with a guide and something always playing live, it relieves some of the decision anxiety that comes with these other apps.

 There are two ways to watch stuff here. The cable TV-like service plays something all day long. There are even specific movie channels that just cycle through films 24/7.

 For an idea of the kind of movies you can find here, some titles I've seen come across my guide include _Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Little Monsters, Orange County_ ,_Equilibrium_ ,_12 Angry Men_ , and_Labor Day_ .

 The other method is as an on-demand movie streaming service. The app makes a clear distinction, so it's easy to switch between the two. This is where you want to be if you want more freedom when choosing your next film. It's easy to see popular, trending, and newly added movies, plus films listed in particular genres.

 There are several ways to stream Pluto TV. The mobile app runs on Android and iOS, and while this is how I stream from here sometimes, I much prefer the TV app because it fits a larger screen better.

 What We Like

* Lots of movies.
* All films have captions.
* Works on lots of devices.
* You don't have to log in.

 What We Don't Like

* Too simple of a search tool.
* Can't sort by popularity.
* Few unique categories to pick from.

 Crackle supports just about every device imaginable, including all popular mobile devices, most smart TVs, streaming players, and gaming consoles, in addition to a regular web browser.

 The interface is easy to work with, and the videos stream smoothly. You don't have to log in to watch movies and TV shows, but the option is there if you need it.

 One thing you won't find in lots of movie apps is the option to sort and filter the results. Although I think there could be more done here to make it even better, it's nice that Crackle lets you filter by genre and sort by title and the date that the movies were added to the app.

 This app works with several devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Android.

 What We Like

* Start watching immediately (no need to sign up).
* Has movies and TV shows.
* Simple, clean app design.
* Unique genres.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks sorting options within each genre.
* Left-to-right scrolling.
* No trailers.

 More free movies and shows can be streamed from the Filmrise app. They add new content every day in genres like horror, crime, action, drama, and documentaries. Some other categories include _Animals, Biopics, Coming of Age, Animated Films, Cops & Robbers_ , and_Action Comedies._

 You don't need a user account to stream movies from this app, nor do you need to sign up to create your own watchlist to keep track of what you want to stream later. You'll see related videos on each movie page to help you find something else you might like.

 Filmrise movies can be streamed from most devices, like Android and iOS, as well as Xbox and Roku.

 What We Like

* Recommends similar movies you might like.
* Highlights movies leaving soon.
* Also has live TV and on-demand TV shows.

 What We Don't Like

* Requires a user account.
* Not as user-friendly as other apps (e.g., horizontally scrolling).
* Doesn't isolate free films from ones that cost.
* Can't sort within a category.
* Movies are mixed in with TV shows.

 The Roku Channel is another source I use for free movies. The app isn't all that interesting since it closely resembles[Roku's website](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/) (which is pretty bland), but there are several genres to pick from, and it's easy to watch the movies on your phone or TV.

 It's easy to find recent releases, featured and recommended films, and relevant categories at certain times of the year, like_Holiday Comedies_ ,_Pride - Love is Love_ , and_Cozy Autumn Movies_ .

 There's also a live TV area that has channels that play movies. Of course, your options are more limited than they are with the on-demand films, but it's a great place to visit if you're not sure what you're in the mood for.

 This app mainly serves as a remote for the Roku, so it's particularly useful if you have a Roku. But you don't need one to watch movies here. It runs on iPhone and Android.

 What We Like

* Helps find free movies all over the web.
* Lots of filtering options to find your next favorite movie or TV show.
* Hide movies marked as seen.

 What We Don't Like

* You need other movie apps installed to watch anything.
* Not everything you see is free.
* Sometimes incorrectly identifies films as free.

 Yidio is more of a streaming_guide_ than an app that lets you watch free movies. This means you can't watch anything directly from this app. Instead, it's useful for telling you exactly where you need to go to find free movies around the web.

 To reiterate, this is more of a search engine for free movies. You can filter the list in numerous ways, such as by premiere date, MPAA rating, IMDb rating, and genre, and even hide the titles you've already seen. Once you land on something to watch, you'll be told where the movie is available for free online.

 On that note, since the movies here aren't actually hosted on Yidio's website, you'll be told to install other apps like Crackle or Fandango at Home. However, a beneficial feature is the ability to filter by installed app. This lets you find movies available in the apps you already have on your device.

 Supported devices include iPhone, iPad, and Android.

 What We Like

* Ad-free app.
* Includes a section of just kids movies.
* Can turn on captions and parental controls.

 What We Don't Like

* Must have a library card.
* Few genres to pick from.

 Kanopy's free movies are only available if you have a library card at a supported library. Once you get logged in, you can stream tens of thousands of free movies directly from your device with zero ads.

 Movies can be browsed by genre to find adventure movies, films about animals, quick flicks, and more. Every film has a rating, a full synopsis, and cast details. There are also related videos below every movie to help you find other films you might like.

 Kanopy Kids is a special area of the app that you can access from the menu. Only kid-friendly movies are visible there, and you can set parental controls if you need to.

 While this app is free and has the awesome benefit of zero ads, I rank it last in this free movie apps list because it's not available to just anyone like these other choices are.

 The app works with iPhone, iPad, Android, and other devices.
