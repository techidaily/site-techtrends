 On some TVs and devices, after highlighting movies, you may need to select**Collections** \>**Showcases** before selecting**3D** .

 If you don't see the 3D listings, you can also type**3D** in the**Search** field, and a listing of available 3D titles will appear. As you select each title, there will be a notice that the 3D version is only available to users with a 3D TV.

 If the device you use to access Fandango at Home is not 3D-compatible, you may not be able to view any 3D movie listings.

##  Streaming 3D Movies in Quality That Rivals Blu-ray 

 In testing Fandango at Home 3D on a number of devices, the results were consistently impressive. Fandango at Home has been known for high-quality video and audio delivery with its HDX format, which rivals the quality of[ Blu-ray discs](https://www.lifewire.com/blu-ray-disc-player-information-1846364) . This is amazing when you consider that the media is streaming to your device rather than playing from physical media.

 Of course, the 3D effects are only as good as the 3D effects of a Blu-ray disc. With a few exceptions, most 3D creates a behind-the-screen depth rather than that jump-out-of-the-TV-and-into-your-living-room action. Disney's "The Christmas Carol" is an example where twirling snowflakes indeed seem to float out into the room.

 Streaming 3D requires an internet speed of 9 Mb/s or more, so be sure you have a fast connection before attempting to stream in 3D. It's a good idea to take up your player's offer to test your connection prior to streaming the movie or preview, to see if you might encounter any[ streaming artifacts or buffering](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-avoid-buffering-issues-1847399) 

## The Bottom Line 

 If you've been looking for content to enjoy on your[ 3D TV](https://www.lifewire.com/3d-tv-pros-and-cons-1847837) , Fandango at Home 3D streaming is an option to consider. However, keep in mind that 3D movie titles are rotated in and out on a periodic basis, so if you see one listed that you would like to see, watch it when you can so you don't miss it. As 3D Blu-rays are released, you'll be able to stream the Fandango at Home 3D versions.

 Fandango at Home provides a quality online video-on-demand viewing experience. If you have a TV, media streamer, or Blu-ray Disc player that is compatible with Fandango at Home 3D streaming, it is a feature worth considering. However,[ with the discontinuation of 3D TV production](https://www.lifewire.com/why-3d-tv-died-4126776) , Fandango at Home may at some point discontinue the 3D portion of its streaming service. if you are a 3D fan, take advantage of it while you can.
