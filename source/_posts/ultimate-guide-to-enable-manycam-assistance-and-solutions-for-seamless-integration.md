2. [Please follow the quick steps below to get your ManyCam Subscription activated:](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)
3. [Troubleshooting](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)

Note 

 This guide applies to [ManyCam 8 only (download here)](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/). 

So you just purchased a ManyCam Subscription, congratulations! You’ll be up and running in just a second.

#### Before you proceed with activating ManyCam (this step is mandatory)

**Make sure you have the latest version of ManyCam installed.** Please go to [download.manycam.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) and click **Download Now** to download the latest ManyCam update. After you installed the update, proceed with the steps below.

#### Please follow the quick steps below to get your ManyCam Subscription activated:

1\. Run the ManyCam application on your machine and click on the **sandwich** icon in the upper-left corner of the ManyCam app, then select **Settings** from the drop-down list.

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1.png)

2\. In the opened window, navigate to the **Account** tab and log into the application using the account you’ve created when you purchased the subscription.

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-2.png)

3\. Once you are in, navigate to the **Subscriptions** tab and make sure your subscription is enabled.

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-3.png)

4\. Close the pop-up message and you’re all set!  

![](https://help.manycam.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-4.png)

Note 

**Activation Codes are no longer used to activate your ManyCam Subscription.** 

#### Troubleshooting

I don't see the settings icon in the app.

In ManyCam 8, the settings icon is located in the upper-left sandwich menu of the application. In ManyCam 7, the icon is in the upper-right corner.

What are devices and video sources?

Each ManyCam subscription limits the number of devices (Windows, macOS desktop) that can be activated concurrently.

**macOS:** In individual subscriptions (Standard, Studio, Premium), one device applies to one user of the operating system (individual subscriptions can’t be shared between users or ManyCam accounts). Multiple activations per user and subscription sharing are available in **Enterprise** and **Education** plans only.

**Windows:** ManyCam subscription is now device-based and acts globally across all OS users and ManyCam apps. Activate multiple editions (desktop, Lite) and instances of ManyCam for Windows simultaneously with a single device activation on a single machine, even if they are installed under multiple OS users.

Video sources are ManyCam video presets located under the [Main Live Window](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) that can be used to create prearranged scenes containing various multimedia materials, effects, video settings, etc. Learn more [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/).

I don't remember creating a ManyCam account.

Most likely you haven’t finalized your purchase yet. In order to finalize it, please find an e-mail “**Action Required: Activate your purchase**” from ManyCam ([support@manycam.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)) in your inbox. Please check your Spam/Bulk/Junk e-mail folders in case you are unable to locate it.

I received the payment confirmation but I don't see my subscription anywhere.

There may be some delay, but don’t worry, you’ll receive an email with all subscription details and activation instructions within 10-15 minutes after your payment has been finalized. Thank you for your patience.

I've unlocked the subscription, but still can't use Chroma key.

Chroma key is a paid feature available in **ManyCam Studio or higher**. ManyCam Standard doesn’t include Chroma key. Please check what subscription plan you have, and if you feel that you need a higher tier subscription, you can [upgrade](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)by paying just the difference.

I purchased incorrect subscription plan, how do i upgrade without repurchasing?

You can upgrade by paying just the difference, please see [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/).

I don't see my subscription in my account.

I purchased the subscription, how do I remove the ManyCam watermark (logo)?

The ManyCam watermark will be removed automatically once you activate the subscription. 

If this doesn’t happen, please make sure you are running the [latest version of the software](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) and check that your subscription is enabled in **ManyCam Settings > Subscriptions**.

I'm getting “Activation limit reached”. What do I do?

The **Activation limit reached** message indicates that you don’t have spare activations left.

You can easily solve this by resetting your activations in your ManyCam account at ManyCam.com. Please refer to this guide: [how to reset your license](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)
