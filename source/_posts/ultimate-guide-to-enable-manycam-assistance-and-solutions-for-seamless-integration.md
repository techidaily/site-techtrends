Note 

**Activation Codes are no longer used to activate your ManyCam Subscription.** 

#### Troubleshooting

I don't see the settings icon in the app.

In ManyCam 8, the settings icon is located in the upper-left sandwich menu of the application. In ManyCam 7, the icon is in the upper-right corner.

What are devices and video sources?

Each ManyCam subscription limits the number of devices (Windows, macOS desktop) that can be activated concurrently.

**macOS:** In individual subscriptions (Standard, Studio, Premium), one device applies to one user of the operating system (individual subscriptions can’t be shared between users or ManyCam accounts). Multiple activations per user and subscription sharing are available in **Enterprise** and **Education** plans only.

**Windows:** ManyCam subscription is now device-based and acts globally across all OS users and ManyCam apps. Activate multiple editions (desktop, Lite) and instances of ManyCam for Windows simultaneously with a single device activation on a single machine, even if they are installed under multiple OS users.

Video sources are ManyCam video presets located under the [Main Live Window](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) that can be used to create prearranged scenes containing various multimedia materials, effects, video settings, etc. Learn more [here](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/).

I don't remember creating a ManyCam account.

Most likely you haven’t finalized your purchase yet. In order to finalize it, please find an e-mail “**Action Required: Activate your purchase**” from ManyCam ([support@manycam.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)) in your inbox. Please check your Spam/Bulk/Junk e-mail folders in case you are unable to locate it.  
Please follow the instructions provided in the email to finalize your purchase. Once done, proceed with activating your subscription by logging into the app using the ManyCam account you’ve just created.

I received the payment confirmation but I don't see my subscription anywhere.

There may be some delay, but don’t worry, you’ll receive an email with all subscription details and activation instructions within 10-15 minutes after your payment has been finalized. Thank you for your patience.

I've unlocked the subscription, but still can't use Chroma key.

Chroma key is a paid feature available in **ManyCam Studio or higher**. ManyCam Standard doesn’t include Chroma key. Please check what subscription plan you have, and if you feel that you need a higher tier subscription, you can [upgrade](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)by paying just the difference.

I purchased incorrect subscription plan, how do i upgrade without repurchasing?

You can upgrade by paying just the difference, please see [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/).

I don't see my subscription in my account.

If you experience this, most likely you haven’t finalized your purchase yet. In order to finalize it, please find an e-mail “**Action Required: Activate your purchase**” from ManyCam ([support@manycam.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)) in your inbox. Please check your Spam/Bulk/Junk e-mail folders in case you are unable to locate it.  
Please follow the instructions provided in the email to finalize your purchase.

I purchased the subscription, how do I remove the ManyCam watermark (logo)?

The ManyCam watermark will be removed automatically once you activate the subscription. 

If this doesn’t happen, please make sure you are running the [latest version of the software](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) and check that your subscription is enabled in **ManyCam Settings > Subscriptions**.

I'm getting “Activation limit reached”. What do I do?

The **Activation limit reached** message indicates that you don’t have spare activations left.

You can easily solve this by resetting your activations in your ManyCam account at ManyCam.com. Please refer to this guide: [how to reset your license](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/)

ManyCam is giving me an error that says 'Network Error' or 'Cannot reach server'. What should I do?

This is the most common error when activating ManyCam. Please refer to [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) to resolve the problem.

Activation failed, unknown error occurred (file corrupted).

 Please refer to [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/manycam/products/) to resolve the issue.
