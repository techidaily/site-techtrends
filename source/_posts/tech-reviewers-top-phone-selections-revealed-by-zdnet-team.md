### Best iPhone 16 case overall

Nomad's website says, "we believe that the smartphone is the 21st-century equivalent of the sword: a tool that everyone can wield and change the world with." This makes Nomad cases a sort of sheath -- or at least one with 8 feet of drop protection and a MagSafe back. The Nomad Sport Case is our pick for the best iPhone 16 case overall to help sheath your new phone.

ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner is a big fan of the Nomad brand. He ranks the Nomad Sport Case as the best phone case for the iPhone 15 Pro, praising it for its sleek design and lightweight feel. "I love how light these cases are. Combined with the noticeably lighter iPhone 15 Pro Max, it feels refreshingly light to hold," Hiner says. Due to the similarities of the 15th and 16th generation of iPhones, the Nomad Sport Case will serve the iPhone 16 just as well.

This light case also offers enough drop protection and raised edges to keep the sensitive parts of your phone safe without a rugged or bulky feel. It provides protection with elegance, making it a perfect resting place for the sword -- or new iPhone 16 -- that is now in your hands. The Nomad Sport case is the perfect mix between lightweight and protective. Nomad also uses ethically-sourced material.

**Nomad Sport Case features:** Comes in four colors | 8 feet of drop protection | MagSafe passthrough

### Best kickstand iPhone 16 case

Torras cases have always been a ZDNET favorite: Hiner called the Ostand case for the iPhone 15 "the most versatile and innovative of the bunch." The newest version fit for the iPhone 16 follows in its footsteps. 

ZDNET Reviews Editor Kerry Wan went hands-on with the Torras case for the iPhone 16 and found it to be super convenient for a few reasons, "for something more multifunctional, Torras' 360-degree OStand case has a MagSafe ring on the back that keeps compatible accessories attached to the iPhone at virtually every angle. You can also pull out and rotate the ring for an optimal, on-the-go viewing experience."

Reddit users agree, with one saying, "The overall production and material quality of the cases is excellent. I've bought multiple Torras cases and screen protectors with my own money in the past, and they always deliver superb quality."

**Torras Ostand MagSafe Case features:** 12 feet military drop protection | MagSafe back | 16ft Military drop protection

## Pitaka Ultra Slim case

### Best thin iPhone 16 case

Bulky phone cases are annoying, especially if you prefer the Plus version of iPhones. Many protective cases have this problem, making them hard to grasp and stick in your pocket. A Pitaka Ultra phone case will fix this problem.

The Pitaka brand boasts thin promises for their cases, and they follow through. ZDNET's Kerry Wan finds it unique but weighs its pros and cons, "Pitaka is one of the originators of the ultra-thin Aramid Fiber case that you see so many brands remix today. With such cases, you're trading drop protection in favor of slimness and minimalism, two aspects that should help reduce any discomfort when handling the larger iPhone 16 models."

Aramid fibers, which is virtually the same as Kevlar, the fabric used in bulletproof vests and aircraft panels. Therefore, the case is durable, scratch-resistant, and protects from everyday wear and tear. If you are looking to find something protective, unique, and thin for your phone, give Pitaka a go. But beware, drop protection is not guaranteed. 

**Pitaka Ultra Slim for iPhone 16** **features:** MagSafe capabilities | Ultra-thin form factor | Camera protection | Aramid fiber material

## Smartish Gripmunk case

### Best cheap iPhone 16 case

Sometimes, the price of a new iPhone leaves you with little money to buy a case. Luckily, there are great options that are less than $25 but serve just as well as the more expensive cases. This is why the Smartish Gripmunk case is our favorite cheap iPhone 16 case.

It has all the features of higher-end cases- grips on the sides, MagSafe capabilities, scratch resistance, and around 6 feet of drop protection. 

"One of the more affordable options, with a grippy texture along the sides to prevent your phone from slipping out of your hands. I'd especially recommend the Clearly Black variant to anyone who wants to show off their iPhone 16 color -- and you definitely should -- without worrying about the case yellowing," said expert tester Kerry Wan.

**Smartish Gripmunk case features:** 6 ft drop protection | MagSafe | Side grips | Camera, screen, and corner protection

## Mous Limitless 6.0

### Best protective iPhone 16 case

Nothing is more disappointing than dropping and shattering your brand-new device, especially if you chose not to opt for Apple Care. If you handle your device with little grace, a protective phone case may be a great preventative option. Our pick, the Mous Limitless 6.0, protects and offers style in one product, so you don't have to sacrifice either.

The case features reinforced corners with their AiroShock technology for ultimate drop protection, which they claim offers 45ft of drop protection. Kerry Wan, who tested out the case, says, "Mous' Limitless 6.0 series is one of the more stylish cases I've tested, with plenty of cushioning for drop protection. There's a generous cut-out for the iPhone 16's Camera Control and the case is offered in various backplates, including Walnut, Bamboo, Leather, and Carbon Fibre. It's my worth-the-splurge pick."

If you find yourself doing more accidental damage to your phone than normal, it may be worth a look into the Mous Limitless 6.0.

**Mous Limitless 6.0 features:** AiroShock 45 ft drop protection | MagSafe | 9 style options | Raised edges

Pros 
* Drop protection
* Raised edges
* Sustainable materials

Cons 
* Pricier
* No camera protection

## Incase Icon

### Best stylish iPhone 16 case

Incase makes great laptop cases, and its designs for iPhone are no different. To best summarize this case, Reddit users describe the Incase Icon as "awesome" and "sexy." 

The case retails for $60 and does not feature the standard plastic or silicone build, but rather a woven design. Many people stick to the former, "but if you prefer the FineWoven feel of last year's iPhone cases, check out the Incase Icon, which comes in a fancy Woolenex finish. The material is lined to be weather-repellant and tear-resistant, but the more impressive part is that it doesn't add much bulk or weight to the iPhone," says reviews editor Kerry Wan, who tested the case.

The Incase Icon has raised edges for screen protection, press-fit buttons, MagSafe capabilities, and 10 feet of drop protection. The case has two material options, plant-based corn leather (which comes in Pebbled Obsidian, Pebbled Cocoa, and Pebbled Oat Milk) and Woolenex woven blend (which comes in Graphite, Navy, Blush Pink, Cosmic Red, and Asphalt). The multitude of color options means the Incase Icon can fit any vibe. 

Incase is a great place to look if you want a simple but stylish case.

**Incase Icon features:** 10 ft of drop protection | MagSafe | Raised edges for screen protection | Color options

### Best vegan-leather iPhone 16 case

Leather is always a stylish option to keep around your phone, but sustainably sourcing it can always be questionable. Moft's Snap Case Movas is our solution to that problem.

The vegan leather finish does not have the grain that traditional leather sports, but rather a smoother texture and five color options-- Misty Cove, Jet Black, Taupe, Earthen Beige, and Cement. 

ZDNET's reviews editor Kerry Wan says, "while Apple didn't replace its FineWoven cases with a vegan leather option this year, Moft's Snap Case is a worthy alternative. The company's Snap Phone Tripod Stand is a crowd-favorite among ZDNET editors, and its Snap Case is just as appreciable. The soft-touch finish contrasts well with the hard-brushed buttons, and there's just enough spacing left for the Camera Control and charging port." 

Although it is not a protective case, it is a stylish alternative if you prefer leather or woven cases. 

**Moft Snap Case Movas features:** Vegan leather | MagSafe | Five color options

## Nomad Modern Leather Case

### Best leather case for iPhone 16

Leather is always a stylish and sleek choice for a phone case. However, it is not always the best at lasting or, sometimes, gripping your phone. That is why the Nomad Modern Leather case is a standout in this category. Even though leather is not the most sustainable material, Nomad asserts it sources it in sustainable ways.

ZDNET's Hiner places the Nomad Leather case on his list of the best cases for iPhone 15 Pro. He writes, "With Apple's leather cases, it would take weeks or months to absorb hand oils and become softer and easier to grip... With Nomad's leather, you don't have to do that. It's soft and feels great in your hands as soon as you take it out of the box. If leather is still your thing, it's a better leather case than the ones Apple used to sell."

That being said, leather is not everybody's thing. But, if you are in the market for a leather case with a MagSafe back, possibly sustainably sourced material, a camera protection, the Nomad Modern Leather case may be your winner.

**Nomad Modern Leather case features:** 8 feet drop protection | Sustainably sourced leather | MagSafe and magnetic back

## Factors to consider when choosing the best iPhone 16 case

We kept in mind the most important factors when choosing the best iPhone 16 cases. The most relevant aspects are:

* **Drop** **Protection:** The hard truth is that all humans are accident-prone. If you are anything like me, dropping your phone is more than a daily occurrence. When picking a phone case, it is wise to consider how often you drop your phone.
* **Style:** iPhone cases go beyond just protecting the device. Like most people, you may want a phone case that matches your personal style and is pleasing to the eye.
* **Cost:** iPhones are expensive, and spending a lot on a phone case just adds to the bill. Therefore, we consider price an important factor in our selections.
* **Special Features:** Many cases have added features like MagSafe capabilities and a kickstand. We include these products to appease those who may prefer wireless charging or other necessary features.

## How did we choose these iPhone 16 cases?

To choose these iPhone 16 cases, we performed extensive research over every corner of the internet, like Reddit forums and customer reviews, to find the best picks at the time of this writing. When we can't test a product, we rely on opinions from real people over company promises. We also receive recommendations  experts like reviews editor Kerry Wan and editor-in-chief Jason Hiner, who have years of experience in the tech journalism field. Our picks are meant to leave the reader happy and their device healthy.

## What iPhone case is most protective?

On this list, the Nomad Sport case and the Torras Ostand MagSafe Case are the most protective for their drop protection and protective features. 

However, if you stray from the list, the best options are those with a solid bumper and durable material. Before purchasing a case, make sure to check its drop protection and other safety features.

## What is the best phone case brand?

Unfortunately, there isn't such a thing as the best phone case brand. Many sources point to Spigen and Otterbox as the most popular phone case brands with the most units sold. That, however, does not necessarily mean they are the best brands. It is ultimately up to you and your lived experience and opinion.

## What case material is best for iPhone?

Materials like plastic or polycarbonate usually offer the best price and durability. Other cases made from leather or metal can be pricier and may not offer the best protection.

## When is the iPhone 16 available?

The iPhone 16 is available for preorder now, and will arrive in stores on September 20.

## What is the best phone case to avoid overheating?

If your phone has the problem of overheating, it may be best to look into specialty cases called heat dissipation cases. These cases are made of heat-wicking material that regulates heat and allows airflow to cool your phone down.

## What is the best iPhone for a 16 year old?

This is a good question, and if we had to chime in, we would say something more durable. A study by tech protection service Asurion in 2013 that [3 out of 10 teenagers have dropped](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/3-out-of-10-teens-damaged-cell-phones-in-the-last-18-months-mainly-at-school-218494391.html#:~:text=A%20back%2Dto%2Dschool%20survey,most%20accidents%20happening%20at%20school.) and/or damaged their cell phones in the past 18 months. Ten years later, many phones are even less durable. Therefore, that number may be higher, especially if teenagers have more phones than ever. To prevent damage to your teen's phone, it may be wise to invest in a durable case that protects the device.

## Are there alternative iPhone 16 cases worth considering?

The internet is filled with many options, so it's no surprise that some products are just as good as the ones on this list. Here are some alternatives that may suit your needs better.
