## Best Free Tools & Apps for Students: Get Ready for Back-to-School
 Summer never lasts long enough for kids, and it can be a stressful time to get everything in order so that students have new clothes, school supplies, dorm stuff, and...back-to-school apps?

 Yes, even the youngest of students can benefit from the wide range of mobile apps that are available today for both smartphones and tablets. We've got kids and have found these eight apps useful for each primary, high school, and even college student in the family.

 And because it's pretty much common sense that most students don't have much of a budget to work with, we focused on apps you can download and use for free (with many offering upgrade options for a small fee).

_If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation._

 What We Like

* Good for block scheduling, non-daily classes.
* Assignment notifications.

 What We Don't Like

* Cannot search for specific assignments.
* Limited integration options outside of the Apple family.

 Remember when calendar planners were popular at school? Well, now students can take all their homework and schedule planning to the digital world with the myHomework app.

 Not only is it incredibly powerful and intuitive to use, but it also features beautiful layouts for both smartphones and tablets. With the free version, students can track their assignments, get due date reminders, receive rewards for completing homework, and more.

 For a small upgrade of $4.99, students can enjoy an ad-free app experience while gaining access to more theme options, a file attachment feature, enhanced app widgets, and external calendar access.

## [Quiz Yourself on Your Knowledge: Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)

![Quizlet.com](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rQT999CdPpGHGirTBSgTI4Yi9Ik=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/free-back-to-school-apps-3486327-3-5b183a611d640400363675b4.jpg)

 What We Like

* Resources are available in dozens of languages.
* Includes helpful tools for teachers and parents.

 What We Don't Like

* Study guide templates aren't ideal for complex subjects.
* Information isn't fact checked; some guides contain errors.

 Similar to StudyBlue, Quizlet is designed to make studying as easy, fun, and effective as possible. You can create your own study materials (flashcards, tests, games) or browse through its vast library of materials created by other users.

 For those who struggle with the old-fashioned textbook study strategy, Quizlet proves to be an ideal alternative for the fact that it supercharges the learning experience with both audio and video components.

 There's even an offline study feature that lets students use the app while they're on the go with no internet connection.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/quizlet-flashcards-study-tools/id546473125)

 What We Like

* Decent voice search capability.
* Suggests synonyms and antonyms for words.

 What We Don't Like

* Cannot increase the text size.
* Features intrusive video ads.

 Essay writing got you down? You’ll probably need a good dictionary and thesaurus to get the job done faster, and lucky for you this app has both rolled into one.

 You get access to over two million words and can even use the “Word of the Day” feature to improve your vocabulary. These apps even work offline, so you can rest easy knowing you can look any word up without an Internet connection.

## [Store All Your Files in One Place: Google Drive](https://get.google.com/apptips/apps/?utm%5Fsource=googlemobile&utm%5Fcampaign=redirect#!/recommended)

![Google.com.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QcIGWC71Vt7J3Q3XVnQk4RLA_us=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/free-back-to-school-apps-3486327-8-5b1842843418c6003744e930.jpg)

 What We Like

* Facilitates painless desktop-to-desktop file syncing.
* Supports hundreds of third-party integrations.

 What We Don't Like

* Less comprehensive than Microsoft 365\.
* No way to password-protect individual folders.

[Cloud storage](https://www.lifewire.com/free-cloud-storage-1356638) is a savior for students, allowing them to share stuff with group members while keeping files updated for access across several devices. And it's the ultimate solution to avoid losing work in the event of a computer crash.

 Everyone uses Google, so Google Drive will keep all your stuff safely tucked away in the cloud for you. In fact, you get 15GB of free storage when you sign up for a Google Drive account, so you'll get one of the best cloud storage offerings available now for free.

 Keep in mind, however, that your Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, Jamboard files, Google Photos, and Gmail messages all will be competing for that storage.

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs)

## [Automate Tasks to Save You Time and Energy: IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)

![IFTTT.com.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MHb8Qoz1irkh8r_qUDeEkpGw4y8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/free-back-to-school-apps-3486327-9-5b18443643a10300367a0f6e.jpg)

 What We Like

* Compatible with many apps and online services.
* Impressive IoT device and voice assistant support.

 What We Don't Like

* No option to create multistep applets.
* Organizational tools are a little lacking.

 Once you start using IFTTT, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Lots of people use it to cross-post the same content on their social channels, but students can create trigger actions for all sorts of other academic and student life purposes.

 Get automatic weather updates via email to prepare for that college football game, auto-generate new notes in Evernote from your Speak notes you took in lecture classes, or turn your Google Calendar events into Todoist tasks.

 It also offers[an additional suite of apps worth checking out](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-iftts-do-apps-3485808) for more specific actions.
