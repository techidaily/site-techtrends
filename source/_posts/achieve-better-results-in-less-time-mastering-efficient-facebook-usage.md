<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 What We Like

* Easy to use, open-source software.

## [ Facebook Ads Manager](https://apps.apple.com/app/facebook-ads-manager/id964397083) 

![Facebook Ads Manager app](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Yx5vNmJ3Tw1nZrP0zQMPmn7Yp2I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005-use-facebook-more-productively-4111274-96be37f9a98d4a9a90ad4489eb4a8142.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 What We Like

* Real-time insights for all ads.
* Easy to switch between Pages and ad accounts.
* Turn ad campaigns on and off.

 What We Don't Like

* Lacks some of the desktop Ads Manager platform capabilities.
* Not ideal for designing new ads.

 If you're the ad manager for your small business, you need the Ads Manager app to keep an eye on your ads when you're on the go. You can track ad performance, create and edit ads, and manage their schedules and budgets right from your phone or tablet.

## [ Facebook Business Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.pages.app) 

![The Facebook Business Suite displaying a business page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uVjKp6Lj1hTjYjvw7_kxX5jcxAE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002-use-facebook-more-productively-4111274-738f2f4cd7b74747b6fbe29ba317e446.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Managing multiple pages on your phone is simple.
* Intuitive calendar for scheduling posts.
* Adds a layer of security.
* It's free.

 What We Don't Like

* Buggy reports following updates.
* No "Save as draft" option.
* Learning curve is not user-friendly.
* Promoting posts and managing ads requires a fee.

 Facebook Business Suite replaces[ Facebook Pages Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-pages-manager-1240568) and contains many of the features contained in Creator Studio.

 Rather than switching back and forth between Facebook,[ Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) , and Instagram, Business Manager checks for all engagement data from one home page that is accessible on both desktop and mobile. Use it to create, schedule, and promote posts, see notifications from Facebook and Instagram accounts, and automate responses to DMs.

 Facebook Business Suite is available as a tablet and phone app for both iOS and Android devices.
