## Top Recommended Samsung Smart TV Applications - Enhance Your Viewing Experience

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 Our Top Picks

## The Roku Channel
