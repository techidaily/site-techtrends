## Diagnosing and Repairing Code 41 Troubles Within Hardware Manager
 This error could apply to any device, but it typically relates to DVD and CD drives, printers, keyboards, and [USB](https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039) devices, so you might see it when you try to use certain hardware devices.

 It'll almost always display in the following way:  

 `Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device. (Code 41)`

## How to Fix a Code 41 Error

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . There's always the possibility that the error was caused by some temporary issue with Device Manager. If so, a simple reboot might fix the problem.  
![Restart in Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JnMKkoa7RsM-V3pIvbugeyqPMF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-afe0f087842b421997c53de5c426bc8a.jpg)
2. Make sure the device is properly connected.  
 If it's inside the PC, check to make sure all the connections are firmly seated and any connectors are properly connected. If this is a newly installed device, check the manual to make sure everything is connected in the correct fashion to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard. For external devices (i.e., connected with a USB cable), try using a different cable.
3. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If the device was previously working, undo any recent changes to the Device Manager by using [System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) .  
![System Restore in the Windows System Properties menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-jeKmxO1adkTVrW1aWBV8Zvfebs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-eedea93734434d5497b45efc10e2c7e0.jpg)
4. [Roll back your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) . If the code 41 error began after updating a particular hardware device, reverting to an older driver version of that driver should help.  
![Roll Back Driver option on the Windows hardware properties menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uGVpPHCmoiNPTIRPuaqMlQnnAA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-06570153b22b46d8a54889d4b955d65b.jpg)
5. [Update the hardware drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . It's possible that installing the latest drivers for the device could fix the code 41 error.  
![Update driver option on the Windows Device Manager menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J_IKzohjeqqSKKwEBnvg2sE4PNQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-f85fd9b0056048ddaa021b6ad4b1794b.jpg)
6. Reinstall the device drivers.  
 This isn't the same as updating a driver. A full driver reinstall involves completely removing the currently installed driver and then letting Windows install it over again from scratch.
7. Delete corrupt registry values. A common cause of code 41 errors is the corruption of two[registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-value-2626042) . Go into the[Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) and[delete the UpperFilters and LowerFilters registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-the-upperfilters-and-lowerfilters-registry-values-2619222) .  
![​UpperFilters Registry Value for DVD GUID (Windows 10)](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GBYHYEksPgQppJ3PMewayJrsENc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/007_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-74a56e2791e74a47abb699e12c0e6aa6.jpg)
8. Remove all associated drivers and software, then reinstall or reconfigure the device.
9. A problem with the device itself might be causing the code 41 error, so you might need to replace the hardware.  
 It's also possible the device isn't compatible with your version of Windows. Check the[Windows Hardware Compatibility List](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-windows-hardware-compatibility-list-2625914) to be sure.
10. If you're sure that a hardware problem isn't causing this particular code 41 error, try to[repair Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) .  
![Startup Repair on the Windows Advance Options menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sUPgWAz92thKxKsT26E498x3YII=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/010_how-to-fix-code-41-errors-2623186-7f8e822dd4b1434cae1c548f99295440.jpg)
11. Perform a [clean install of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) as a last resort to start with a fresh copy of the operating system.  
 All the information on your[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) will be erased if you complete this step.
