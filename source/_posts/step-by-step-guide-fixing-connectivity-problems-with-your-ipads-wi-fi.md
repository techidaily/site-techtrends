## [Customizable Notes: Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)

![Screen Shot of iPad Note-Taking App, Note Taking: Notes & NotebookNotepad plus Markdown Writer React Apps Pty Ltd](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MbKvv1tpHWkwSwZJMDdlHQCMaJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ScreenShot2018-07-09at10.39.39PM-5b441de2c9e77c00371bd2c5.png)

​

 What We Like

* Process drafts quickly with features like Link Mode.
* Incredible customization power.
* Convert to-do lists, notes, messages, and emails.
