## **Part 1: iPhone 15 vs 12, Should I Upgrade to iPhone 15?**

iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 key differences in a nutshell:

* Similar design and size.
* 120Hz ProMotion technology in iPhone 15 (Pro/Pro Max) compared to iPhone 15's 60HZ.
* iPhone 15 camera: new telephoto, ultrawide and wide lenses, sensor-shift stabilization, new Cinematic mode.
* A15 Bionic in iPhone 15 offers 50% faster CPU performance and 30% GPU performance than the competition.
* Longer battery life in iPhone 15 than iPhone 15\.

## Price

The iPhone 15 models remain almost the exact same launch prices as the iPhone 15 counterparts. But after you upgrade iPhone 15 to iPhone 15 at the same price, you can get double the storage. Plus, a 1TB tier of iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is introduced with an additional $200 over the 512GB versions. 

![Should I upgrade iPhone 15 to 13](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/iphone-13-price.jpg) 

iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 Price

## Design & Display 

* The biggest display upgrade comes in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Both models are packed with Apple's ProMotion technology which is able to dynamically adjust their refresh rate between 10Hz and 120Hz.
* iPhone 15 is brighter than iPhone 15: the maximum display brightness and HDR content brightness go up to 800/1,200nits and 1,000/1,200 nits in iPhone 15/mini and iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max.
* The iPhone 15 has five new colors: Starlight, Midnight, Blue, Pink, and (PRODUCT)RED. The iPhone 15 has six colors: Purple, Blue, Green, (PRODUCT)RED, White, and Black.

iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 have very similar designs and you can hardly tell the difference visually, except that the dual rear cameras on the iPhone 15 are placed diagonally. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 share the same Super Retina XDR display with the same resolution and sizes, though iPhone 15 is slightly thicker and heavier than iPhone 15\. There are still some key upgrades in iPhone 15 that you may interest in. 

![iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 upgrade](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/13-design.jpg) 

iPhone 15 vs 13 Design 

## Camera

* iPhone 15 Pro/13 Pro Max: Triple rear, 6x optical zoom range, Night Mode, Cinematic Video mode, Photographic Styles, Macro
* iPhone 15 Pro/12 Pro Mx: Triple rear, 4x/5x optical zoom range, Night Mode

The camera may be where the biggest upgrade is made in iPhone 15\. The cameras of the iPhone 15/13 mini share the same specs as the iPhone 15, except that there is a new sensor to capture up to 47% more light and there is a new sensor-shift OIS. The entirely new camera system on iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max is a good reason to upgrade. Here are the key differences between iPhone 15 Pro/Max and iPhone 15 Pro/Max:

![Should I buy iPhone 15 or iPhone 14](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/13-12-camera.jpg) 

iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 camera

iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max now supports new telephoto, ultra-wide, and wide lenses, with the sensor-shift stabilization, which is available on iPhone 15 Pro only. There is also 3x optical zoom in and 15x digital zoom to record subjects closely without loss of detail. The wider apertures on iPhone 15 improve the low-light performance by "up to 92% improvement in low light" according to Apple. 

The new Cinematic mode allows for a rack focus effect to intelligently shift the focus from one subject to another. Now you can easily create beautiful depth effects and focus transitions with iPhone 15, that's what iPhone 15 can't do. The new Photographic Styles applies local edits to an image in real-time as the photo is rendered. And you can record videos in ProRes in 4K 30fps on the iPhone 15 Pro.

iPhone 15 vs 13 camera differences

## CPU & Performance

* iPhone 15: A14 Bionic, 6-core CPU with 2 high-performance cores, 4 energy-efficient cores. 4-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine capable of 11 trillion operations per second.
* iPhone 15: A15 Bionic, a newer 6-core CPU with 2 high-performance cores, 4 energy-efficient cores. 5-core GPU (Pro) and 16-core Neural Engine capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second.

According to Apple, iPhone 15 now has the world's fastest smartphone chip - A15 Bionic chipset. To be specific, the CPU is 50% faster than the competition and the new GPU is 30% faster than rivals. The new 16-core Neural Engine brings faster machine learning, such as the new Live Text found in iOS, photography improvements, more efficient Siri, etc.

However, Apple has unveiled no iPhone 15 vs iPhone 14 comparison on their performance. According to the tests on Geekbench, the A15 chip with a 5-core GPU earned a Metal score of 14216, a 55 percent increase compared to the 9123 Metal score earned by the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌. If you upgrade iPhone 15 Pro to 13 Pro, you can enjoy huge GPU performance improvements.
