###  What to Know

* Enable cheats, open the chat window, and enter the Tp command. For example: /tp yourName
* If successful, you will receive a confirmation message and be teleported to the indicated location.
* You can teleport anyone or anything anywhere with the Tp command.

 This article explains how to use the Tp (teleport) command in Minecraft for all platforms, including Windows PC, PS4, and Xbox One. You'll find several examples at the end of this piece.

##  How to Use the Minecraft Teleport Command

 With the Tp command in Minecraft, you can teleport anyone or anything, anywhere. If you're playing the Java version, you can also teleport between the Overworld and the Nether.

 Use the Tp cheat the same way you use any other Minecraft cheat:

1. Enable cheats in your world's settings.

2. Open the chat window. How you do this depends on which platform you're playing on:  
   * PC: Select the**T** key.  
   * Mobile: Tap the**Chat** icon at the top of the screen.  
   * Xbox: Select**Right** on the D-Pad.  
   * PlayStation: Select**Right** on the D-Pad.

##  How Coordinates Work in Minecraft

 When you enter coordinates in Minecraft, you need to provide three variables: X, Y, and Z:

* **X** : The X coordinate represents longitude. As the player moves east, the value of X increases. As the player moves west, the value of X decreases.
* **Y** : The Y coordinate represents elevation. As the player moves up, the value of Y increases. As the player moves down, the value of Y decreases.
* **Z** : The Z coordinate represents latitude. As the player moves south, the value of Z increases. As the player moves north, the value of Z decreases.

 One unit represents one block. The sea level for the overworld is 62Y, and the lava “sea” level is 11Y. In the Nether, the lava “sea” level is 31Y.

 To display your current coordinates in the Java Edition, enter**/tp \~\~\~** . In Bedrock Edition, enable**Show Coordinates** in the world settings.

##  How to Teleport to Coordinates in Minecraft

 To teleport any player or object to a specific set of coordinates, you just need to provide the X, Y, and Z coordinates. For example:

 /tp PluckyChart7166 150 64 250

 The above command teleports the player PluckyChart7166 to the coordinates 150X, 64Y, 250Z.

##  Teleport to a Relative Set of Coordinates

 To teleport an object to a location relative to its current position, add a**tilde** (**\~** ) to the coordinates. For example:

 /tp PluckyChart7166 ~150 ~ 64 ~250

##  Teleport to Another Object

 It's also possible to teleport directly to another player or object. For example:

 /tp PluckyChart7166 Rob4Lifewire

 The above command teleports the player PluckyChart7166 to the player Rob4Lifewire.
