## What to Look for in the Best Gameplay Video Recorder Software

**OUTPUT QUALITY** \- _"I'm trying to record gameplays in order to upload them to YouTube. The problem is that they are of too low quality..."_ many users are complaining about poor output quality of recorded gameplay videos. Quality is the most significant factor to consider when choosing a gameplay walkthrough catpure software. Good quality is a must. Of course, the game recorder doesn't lag the video game you are playing, otherwise, it sucks. 

**EXTRAS** \- Many gamers like me prefer to record [360 VR game](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) videos and upload to YouTube. Quality aside, there are many other issues to consider, for example, file size, video format, video editing. Sometimes, the gameplay capture software gives pretty good quality, but large file size for the output video is a huge turn off, making it a time consuming process to post to YouTube. Or even worse, the video format is unaccepted by the video sharing site. It is much better for a HD gameplay recorder program to embrace bonus features, say, ability to [compress large gameplay video files size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), change recorded gameplay video to YouTube supported format, cut to get the best part you're really interested to show, download video gameplay soundtrack music etc. 

**NO ADS VIRUS** \- We all hate ads. Ads or spam and such likes can be intrusive and ruin our good mood. Many free online gameplay recorder software is loaded with links to cheats, spam, malware. So the best video game recording software should be clean, with no ads, virus, links to malicious sites, spam, malware, and the like. 

## Best HD Gameplay Video Recorder Software for Mac and PC

It is hard for a gameplay recorder tool to boast all the whistles and bells, but it is possible. [**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is the best-ever software for gameplay recording I've been using for months. It is one of the most comprehensive video game capture software. The program focuses on gameplay recording output quality, and edges out other advanced software thanks to High Quality Engine developed and used by the software developer. You can't even tell the difference between the video game and the gameplay capture itself. 

The gameplay screen capture program offers opportunity to compress large gameplay video file size and keeps good balance between size and quality. Did I mention that it allows you to convert recorded gameplay walkthrough videos to MP4, AVI, MOV etc. format for uploading or playback on iPhone iPad Android devices?

It has stunning extra features like cropping, trimming to remove unwanted area and get the most exciting parts, adjusting frame rate, bit rate, resolution etc. You can also put watermarks and titles in recorded gameplay video.
