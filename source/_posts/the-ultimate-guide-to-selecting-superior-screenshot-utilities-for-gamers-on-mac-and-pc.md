## What to Look for in the Best Gameplay Video Recorder Software

**OUTPUT QUALITY** \- _"I'm trying to record gameplays in order to upload them to YouTube. The problem is that they are of too low quality..."_ many users are complaining about poor output quality of recorded gameplay videos. Quality is the most significant factor to consider when choosing a gameplay walkthrough catpure software. Good quality is a must. Of course, the game recorder doesn't lag the video game you are playing, otherwise, it sucks. 

**EXTRAS** \- Many gamers like me prefer to record [360 VR game](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) videos and upload to YouTube. Quality aside, there are many other issues to consider, for example, file size, video format, video editing. Sometimes, the gameplay capture software gives pretty good quality, but large file size for the output video is a huge turn off, making it a time consuming process to post to YouTube. Or even worse, the video format is unaccepted by the video sharing site. It is much better for a HD gameplay recorder program to embrace bonus features, say, ability to [compress large gameplay video files size](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), change recorded gameplay video to YouTube supported format, cut to get the best part you're really interested to show, download video gameplay soundtrack music etc. 

**NO ADS VIRUS** \- We all hate ads. Ads or spam and such likes can be intrusive and ruin our good mood. Many free online gameplay recorder software is loaded with links to cheats, spam, malware. So the best video game recording software should be clean, with no ads, virus, links to malicious sites, spam, malware, and the like.
