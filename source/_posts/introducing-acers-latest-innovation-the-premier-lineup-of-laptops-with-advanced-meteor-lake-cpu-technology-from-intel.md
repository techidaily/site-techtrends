## Introducing Acer’s Latest Innovation: The Premier Lineup of Laptops with Advanced Meteor Lake CPU Technology From Intel

Intel has finally [revealed its 14th Gen "Meteor Lake" CPUs](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/elevate-your-profiles-visual-appeal-for-2024/), and Acer is among the first computer brands to leap for the new technology. Starting today, you can purchase an Acer Swift Go 14 laptop with a Meteor Lake CPU. Acer is also showing off the all-new Predator Triton Neo 16, which is slated for next year.

##  The All-New Predator Triton Neo 16

 Designed for gaming and content creation, the new Acer Predator Triton Neo 16 packs Intel's latest CPUs and NVIDIA's 40-series GPUs. It also uses a large 16-inch display, which features a 3.2K resolution and 165Hz refresh rate in some configurations.

 You can choose an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, Ultra 7 155H, or Ultra 5 125H CPU when purchasing the Predator Triton Neo 16\. The most powerful configuration of this laptop includes an NVIDIA 4070 GPU with DLSS 3.0 enhancements. The storage goes up to 2TB (PCIe Gen 4 NVMe), while the maximum RAM configuration clocks in at 32GB (LPDDR5X).

 Interestingly, this laptop is loaded with Acer's latest AeroBlade 3D fan, liquid metal thermal grease, and vector airflow pipes. A dedicated PredatorSense key allows you to quickly switch between laptop performance modes, and shine-through keycaps are used to accommodate a very tidy 3-zone RGB system.

 Acer has not revealed the Predator Triton Neo 16's battery life. It's a gaming laptop, so the battery life probably isn't too amazing, but there should be some benefit from the combined use of Intel's new "AI Boost" technology and NVIDIA's DLSS enhancements. Intel AI Boost reduces the power consumption of AI tasks, while DLSS uses AI to simulate a higher resolution and frame rate in some games (thereby reducing the power consumption of the GPU).

 Anyway, the laptop's port selection is very comprehensive. Official images show that the Predator Triton Neo 16 has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a pair of USB-A ports, an HDMI jack, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, and a barrel jack power connector. There's also a Kensington lock on the device's side.

 The Predator Triton Neo 16 starts at $1,500\. But it doesn't launch until March 2024, and as a result, we still don't know all the specs.

##  The Upgraded Swift Go 14

Acer

 It's been nearly a year since the [Acer Swift Go 14's reveal](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-enhancing-youtube-beauty-mastering-video-color-dynamics-for-2024/) at CES 2023\. It was one of the first laptops to use Intel's range of 13th Gen CPUs, and now, it's getting the Meteor Lake upgrade.

 The Swift Go laptop is Acer's answer to the MacBook Air. It offers plenty of premium features, including a powerful CPU and a gorgeous display, but it relies on integrated graphics and has a fairly compact design (neither of which are _bad_ things, per se).

 Starting today, Acer will offer the Swift Go 14 laptop with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H and Ultra 5 125H configurations. These CPUs offer a bit of extra processing power, though they're more notable for their "Intel AI Boost" functionality, which reduces the power draw of local AI tasks.

 All models of the Swift Go laptop use a 1440p QHD webcam and are enhanced by video conferencing AI. Acer makes liberal use of noise reduction, image correction, and automatic framing technology, which require a lot of power. Of course, there are plenty of software applications that now use AI, and Windows 11 is slowly gaining Copilot features. The Intel AI Boost technology curbs some of this power consumption to achieve a 12.5-hour battery life in Acer's upgraded Swift Go 14 (up from 9 hours).

 Beyond its Meteor Lake CPU, the upgraded Swift Go 14 hasn't changed too much. Customers can purchase this laptop with an IPS touchscreen display or an OLED display. The maximum RAM configuration clocks in at 32GB (LPDDR5X), while storage configurations cap out at 1TB (PCIe Gen 4). You can buy the upgraded Swift Go 14 today with prices starting at $800.
