## How to Enable a New Mail Sound for Gmail

 If you want to hear a new email sound when you use Gmail in your desktop web browser, you can make that happen—just not in Gmail itself.

 Since Gmail doesn't support pushing sound notifications through a web browser, you must install a third-party program like[Notifier for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-gmail/dcjichoefijpinlfnjghokpkojhlhkgl?hl=en) (a Chrome extension).

 If you're using the Notifier for Gmail Chrome extension:

1. Select**Extensions** next to Chrome's navigation bar, then select**More actions** (three vertical dots) and choose **Options** .

## How to Enable a Pop-Up Notification
