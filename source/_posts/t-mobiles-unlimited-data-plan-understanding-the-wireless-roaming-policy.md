## T-Mobile's Unlimited Data Plan: Understanding the Wireless Roaming Policy
 Like most major wireless carriers in the U.S., Metro by T-Mobile (formerly MetroPCS) no longer charges a per-minute roaming fee on domestic accounts. Instead, Metro by T-Mobile service spans the entire[nationwide T-Mobile network](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map) . If you end up somewhere that's not in the company's coverage area, you're automatically switched to a T-Mobile carrier partner's network, so you'll get connectivity outside the T-Mobile network.

 Even with no per-minute roaming fees, you may experience restricted or slowed service, or a suspension, if you run up excessive out-of-zone phone time. It's a good idea to make sure Metro by T-Mobile's coverage areas align with where you use your phone most of the time.

## Metro by T-Mobile Services

 Metro by T-Mobile offers several domestic service packages, none of which incur per-minute roaming charges in the nationwide coverage area or on the networks of T-Mobile partners.

 Metro by T-Mobile plans don't require a contract, so it's easy to switch to a plan that makes more sense for you and your family.[Popular Metro by T-Mobile plans](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/phone-plans) include a 10 GB plan for $40 per month and an unlimited data plan for $50 per month (you get discounts when you add lines).

## International Roaming

 While you won't experience per-minute roaming fees in the nationwide coverage area with Metro by T-Mobile plans, you may incur roaming charges when you travel internationally. International roaming is possible with Metro by T-Mobile because of partner agreements between T-Mobile and some international carriers. International roaming fees vary, and fees can quickly add up.

 See[Metro by T-Mobile's Terms of Service International Roaming](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/terms-and-conditions/international-roaming) for specific information about the Metro by T-Mobile international roaming program.
