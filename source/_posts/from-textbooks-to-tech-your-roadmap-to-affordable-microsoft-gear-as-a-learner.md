### What to Know

* Go to**Insert** \>**Object** \>**Microsoft Word Document** \>**OK** to prepare a new document.
* Then, paste the source code into that document and save it to automatically embed the code in the first document.
* You can also use**Paste Special** to insert a variety of data into a document, including code.

 This article explains how to insert code in Word. Directions apply to Word 2010 and newer, including Word 2021 and Microsoft 365.  

## How to Insert Code in Word With an Embedded Document

 While there isn't an 'insert code' option or a dedicated code block in Word, there is a way to insert one document into another. This effectively creates an isolated section that houses all the code. Here's how to make this work with your code:

These instructions only work with a single page of code.

1. Open the document you want the code to appear in, and select**Insert** .

7. [Copy and paste the source code](https://www.lifewire.com/cut-copy-and-paste-in-microsoft-word-4159583) into the new document. Word automatically ignores the spaces, tabs, and other formatting problems. Spelling errors and grammatical errors are highlighted in the document, but these errors are ignored when the code is inserted in the original document.

## Using Different Paste Types in Word

 Modern versions of Word handle code better than they used to. Word for[Microsoft 365](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-office-4156573) supports several forms of pasting, including with and without source formatting. So pasting a block of code from your code-editing app will look different based on the paste type.

 If you select**Home** \>**Paste Special** , each of the three options yields a different result:

* **Unformatted Text** : All code is pasted as unformatted, so you'll lose indenting, color, typeface, and related contextual clues.
* **HTML Format** : This renders what appears to be a photo of the code, complete with the text editor's background color. This code block is editable, and you can remove the background color if you wish.
* **Unformatted Unicode Text** : Pastes the text as is but strips the text and background colors. Re-format the code as needed.

## The Problem With Using Source Code in Word

 Programmers write software programs using languages like Java, C++, and HTML. Programming languages use different formatting and symbols from regular languages, so pasting a snippet of code into Word from a programming application causes errors such as text reformatting, indentation shifts, link creation, and misspellings.

 Given how Microsoft Word structures documents, inserting and working with source code is more difficult than working in a dedicated code editor. However, despite missing a code block option, Word's document embed feature creates a container that protects source code from being reformatted.
