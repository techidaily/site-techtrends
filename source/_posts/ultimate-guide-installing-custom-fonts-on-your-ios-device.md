## Ultimate Guide: Installing Custom Fonts on Your iOS Device
### What to Know

* Currently, only apps like Pages and Keynote allow you to switch fonts.
* Installing fonts on an iPhone requires the use of a separate app, such as iFont or Fonteer.
* You can download new and custom fonts through a web browser but need a separate font app to install them.

## How Can I Download Free Fonts to My iPhone?

 The simplest way to download new fonts to your iPhone is to use a third-party app. We recommend apps like[iFont](https://apps.apple.com/app/ifont-find-install-any-font/id1173222289) and[Fonteer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fonteer/id1065830434) but you can find a number of others on the App Store just by searching for “fonts.”

## How Do I Install Fonts Using iFont?

 IFont offers free font downloads and installation, supported by ads. You can use it to download fonts from Google Fonts, Dafont, and Fontspace. You can also use it to install fonts you may have downloaded separately.

 Each of iFont’s available font libraries uses a different layout, so navigation is slightly different between the three of them.

1. Download, install, and open iFont.
2. From the main page of the app, tap**Find Fonts to Install** .
3. Tap the font library you’d like to access (Google Fonts, Dafont, or Fontspace), or tap**Open Files** to install fonts you’ve downloaded outside of iFont.

4. If downloading from a font library, find a font you want to download and tap**Download** .

## How Do I Download Custom Fonts on iOS?  

 Downloading custom fonts works the same as it does with downloading fonts from the internet to your phone. All you have to do is visit a custom font website such as Fontspace and then download and install your chosen fonts using iFont as detailed above.  

## How Do I Uninstall Fonts on My iPhone?  

 If for any reason you decide you no longer want to use any of the fonts you installed, you can remove them. Despite what you might think, these installed fonts do not appear in the Fonts section of your iPhone’s settings.  
 Fonts added in batches, as with Fonteer, cannot be removed individually. By deleting the profile, you will delete all of the fonts grouped within it.
46. Open the iPhone’s**Settings** . Scroll down and tap**General** .
47. Scroll down and tap**Profiles** .
48. In the Profiles menu, you’ll see all the font profiles you’ve installed.
