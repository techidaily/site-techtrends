## Effective Fixes for Common Parsing Mishaps on Android Devices – Learn Our Top 8 Tips
 A parse error message sometimes shows up when an[app](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114) fails to install. If you've received a parse error and still want to install the app in question, you'll need to identify and fix the root problem.

## What's the Cause of an Android Parse Error?

 The parse error usually occurs when you try to install or run a[third-party app](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-third-party-app-4154068) . The message itself isn't very specific, and there are a lot of problems that can cause it. The main takeaway is that your phone experienced a problem when trying to install the app, so the installation wasn't completed.

 When this error occurs, you'll see a message like this:

 `Parse Error`
`There was a problem parsing the package.`

 The error can also happen when you try to install an app from the official Google Play Store, although that's less common.

 Here are some of the most common causes of the Android parse error:

* The app isn't compatible with your device.
* Your phone doesn't have permission to install the app.
* The file you're trying to install is corrupt, incomplete, or damaged.
* A security app is preventing installation.
* There's a problem with your Android device.
* Changes have been made to the app you're trying to install.

## How to Fix a Parse Error

 Below are our best suggestions for fixing an Android parse error. After completing each fix, try installing the app once again. If you still see the error, move on to the next step.

1. [Update to the latest version of Android](https://www.lifewire.com/update-your-android-os-121662) . The app you're trying to install may not work with an older OS version. In rare circumstances, trying to install or run an app that's designed for a newer version of Android will result in a parse error.  
 If you have an older device, but your carrier doesn't support the latest OS update, you may need to[get a new phone](https://www.lifewire.com/best-places-to-buy-cell-phones-580000) . In some cases, you might be able to install a custom version of Android by[rooting your device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-root-your-android-phone-121676) .  
 Installing a custom version of Android is a complicated procedure. It's not uncommon for inexperienced users to brick or permanently damage their device when attempting a custom install.
2. Try an older version of the app. If the app you're trying to install requires a newer Android version, consider installing a previous edition of the app instead, if one is available (contact the developer or use a site like[Uptodown](https://uptodown-android.en.uptodown.com/android) ).  
 Running old versions of apps can open your device up to security vulnerabilities.
3. [Enable permissions to install apps from unknown sources](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-apps-on-android-devices-4582094) . If you're trying to install an app that you didn't get from the official app store, you may be getting a parse error message because your device isn't set up to install apps that way.  
 This option is turned off by default. If you turn it on, be careful to only download apps from trusted sources.
4. [Download and install the APK file again](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185) . If your app files are corrupt or incomplete, it can cause a parse error to occur. Return to the website where you originally downloaded the[APK file](https://www.lifewire.com/apk-file-4152929) , and download it again. If you can find a different version from a trusted source, get it there instead.
5. Temporarily disable your antivirus app, if you have one. Antivirus and other security apps can incorrectly identify the app you're trying to install as a threat, resulting in the parse error message. Shutting off the security app, at least temporarily, might allow you to successfully install the app.  
 However, only do this if you're absolutely sure the app is, in fact, safe to use. Check it against an online virus scanner like[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to be sure.  
 If you're not sure how to complete this step, just[uninstall the antivirus app](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-on-android-phone-5271421) instead. Then, try to install your app once more. If it works this time, remember to reinstall the antivirus app. You might need to allow your app as an exception in the AV app to prevent future threat detections.
6. [Turn on USB debugging](https://www.lifewire.com/enable-usb-debugging-android-4690927) . It's unclear why this works, but we've seen some users avoid the parse error after doing this.
7. If you modified the manifest file, restore it. This potential fix applies to advanced users only. If you're not sure what this means, just skip this step.  
 Changing the name of the APK file or making other changes to the Androidmanifest.xml file contained in the app, can sometimes cause a parse error. Try restoring the file to its original state, then install the app again with its original name.
8. [Factory reset your Android phone](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-android-smartphone-tablet-4129141) . This is a last resort option, as it will erase all your data. Do not attempt it unless you've tried every other option. After you factory reset your phone, you'll have to update it to the latest version of Android before trying to install the app again.  
[Back up any data you don't want to lose](https://www.lifewire.com/backup-android-phone-4177052) before resetting your device. A reset will wipe away all your apps, photos, texts, contacts, videos, etc., that aren't backed up.
