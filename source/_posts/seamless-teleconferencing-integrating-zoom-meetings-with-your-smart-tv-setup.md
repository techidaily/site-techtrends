 This article outlines how to cast a Zoom meeting from your computer or smartphone using Chromecast, Roku, and AirPlay.

##  How to Cast Zoom to a TV With Chromecast 

 One of the easiest ways to do a Zoom cast is with a[ Chromecast](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213) . Some TVs have Chromecast built-in, but it's also available as a separate streaming device. It lets you cast your whole computer, a single browser tab, or your phone screen.

###  Cast Zoom From a Computer 

 All you need is the Chrome web browser. Here's how to see your Zoom call on the TV:

1. [ Launch the Zoom meeting](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-set-up-and-join-a-zoom-meeting-4801148) as you normally would on your computer. Wait until everyone is connected and you can view the video feeds of other participants.  
![Screenshot of launching a Zoom meeting](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nh_FcoQ55nvsD2HZPwvntUa3RHA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-cast-a-zoom-meeting-to-your-tv-5072122-1-e707c5429c2448e08dfc59df8a6b1f50.jpg)
2. Open Chrome's**three-dot menu** at the top right, and then go to**Save and share** \>**Cast** .
3. Select**Sources** and then**Cast screen** .  
![The Cast Screen option selected on the Zoom website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/7z_JqKyGRJg1d0REYQDHSwZq_-4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/zoom-cast-screen-e894e6db218d4e28aff76b5883311fc9.png)  
 Choose**Cast tab** if you're using the Zoom web client (i.e., the meeting exists in your Chrome browser). The**Cast screen** option will[ cast your whole desktop to your TV](https://www.lifewire.com/use-chromecast-to-show-windows-desktop-4129536) , which is necessary if Zoom is running through the desktop app.
4. You’ll see a pop-up window where you can select which monitor to cast. Choose the one that’s displaying the Zoom meeting and select**Share** .  
![Screenshot of sharing Zoom meeting in Windows.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/m5r5LnQNLNNwLyy4STK8APeSud8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/A4-CastaZoomMeetingtoYourTV-annotated-48252d1f6ed4401390d9607a9837b372.jpg)

 Although you can watch the TV to see everyone in the meeting, your laptop webcam is still the one participants use to see you, so try to keep your computer in front of you to appear more natural during the meeting. Alternatively, you could[ get an external webcam](https://www.lifewire.com/before-you-buy-a-webcam-2640480) for some flexibility with where you sit.

### Cast Zoom From a Phone 

 Android users can[ mirror their display to a Chromecast-enabled TV](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-cast-screen-from-android-to-tv-4769259) via the Google Home app. It's as easy as tapping a few buttons.

1. Open the[ Google Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app) and select the Chromecast from the**Devices** tab.
2. Tap**Cast my screen** .
3. Tap**Cast screen** to mirror your phone's display and audio on your TV.
4. Open Zoom to cast your Zoom call to your TV. As long as the Zoom app is front and center on your phone or tablet, you'll also see it on your TV.  
![Screenshot of the steps to take to cast a screen on Google Home app.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Wggr1xhBnB-1ye16xuglB-7u0G0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B4-CastaZoomMeetingtoYourTV-annotated-031297447e9f4f07b1703d0bda0a41ec.jpg)  
 Turn your phone to landscape mode so the call fills the entire screen. Also, consider[ going into Do Not Disturb mode](https://www.lifewire.com/use-do-not-disturb-on-android-4688870) to avoid alerts that might go off during the meeting.

##  How to Use Roku for Casting Zoom to a TV 

 Roku users are in luck! Much like Chromecast, the[ screen mirroring feature built-in to Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/cast-to-roku-from-another-device-4176162) can display a Zoom call on the TV via a phone or computer.
