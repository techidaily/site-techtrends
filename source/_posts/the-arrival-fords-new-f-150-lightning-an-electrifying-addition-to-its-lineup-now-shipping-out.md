## The Arrival: Ford's New F-150 Lightning, an Electrifying Addition to Its Lineup Now Shipping Out!

Ford revealed its [F-150 Lightning electric truck](https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/f150-lightning/) last year, serving as another sign that legacy auto companies are shifting to electric vehicles. Now the truck has finally started shipping to buyers.Related: [Geek Comic for February 10th – Unwanted Feedback](https://www.reviewgeek.com/104798/everything-we-know-about-the-tesla-cybertruck/)The Ford F-150 Lightning was [unveiled last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/from-anti-tesla-design-to-huge-frunk-5-things-about-fords-f-150-lightning.html), with a traditional truck design on the outside and all-electric internals. It immediately drew comparisons toÂ [Tesla's in-development Cybertruck](https://www.reviewgeek.com/104798/everything-we-know-about-the-tesla-cybertruck/), with a Ford representative saying at launch that its customers "did not want their truck to look like a doorstop or a spaceship" --- a clear jab at the Cybertruck's polygonal design. The truck also has a large front trunk (a "frunk") for storage, in addition to the rear bed, and enough built-in outlets to power tents and small homes for a short time. The truck was originally intended to start at $52,974 and max out at around $90,000, but as our sister site ReviewGeek pointed out, many dealerships were pricing high-end models for [as much as $145,000](https://www.reviewgeek.com/117911/ford-f-150-lightning-prices-exceed-145k-as-dealers-break-rules/).Bloomberg reports that Michigan residentÂ Nicholas Schmidt received the first delivery of an Ford F-150 Lightning on Thursday, May 26\. He told Bloomberg that he owns a Tesla Model 3, and had a deposit for the upcoming Cybertruck --- he [later tweeted](https://twitter.com/oneguynick/status/1530203735309357057) that the reservation was "no longer needed."

 The market for electric trucks in the United States is quickly accelerating (pun intended), with startup company [Rivian also starting to ship its R1T truck](https://www.reviewgeek.com/149012/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review/). Tesla has delayed the Cybertruck multiple times, with the car not expected to arrive until sometime in 2023\. Tesla is also facing [production difficulties](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-delays-plan-restore-shanghai-plant-output-pre-lockdown-levels-memo-2022-05-16/), and CEO Elon Musk is currently busy with a [chaotic acquisition of Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/26/twitter-shareholders-sue-elon-musk-and-twitter-over-chaotic-deal.html).

 Even though the F-150 Lightning seems impressive on paper, its massive design has opened it to the same criticisms as traditional pickup trucks. The ever-increasing height and size of trucks limits the visibility of drivers, with [Consumer Reports finding](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/the-hidden-dangers-of-big-trucks/) that some trucks now have "front blind spots 11 feet longer than those in some sedans, and 7 feet longer than in many popular SUVs." The F-150 Lightning also [weighs 6,500 pounds](https://slate.com/business/2021/05/ford-f150-lightning-electric-weight.html), more than 35% heavier than the gas-powered model --- making injury more likely for any pedestrians hit by the truck.
