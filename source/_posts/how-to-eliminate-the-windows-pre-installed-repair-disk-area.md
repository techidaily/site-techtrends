## The Ultimate Troubleshooting Guide to Addressing and Repairing WHEA Errors on PCs
 The Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA) uncorrectable error is a Windows[stop code](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-stop-code-2625685) displayed on a[blue screen](https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-of-death-bsod-2625816) . When this error occurs, your computer will typically compile some diagnostic data then reset. If the root problem persists, your computer will eventually crash again with the same WHEA uncorrectable error message.

 WHEA uncorrectable errors are usually associated with faulty hardware, but they can also be caused by driver conflicts, missing Windows updates, and even[overclocking](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-overclocking-a-computer-4092341) .

## How the WHEA Uncorrectable Error Appears

 When this error occurs, you'll usually see a message like one of these:

* Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you.  
 If you'd like to know more, you can search online for this error: WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR
* A problem has been detected, and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.

## Causes of the WHEA Uncorrectable Error

 The WHEA uncorrectable error is a stop code displayed during blue screen crashes and is usually due to hardware failure. A failing hard drive, defective memory, improperly seated CPU, and a variety of other hardware issues can all result in a WHEA uncorrectable error.

 In addition to faulty hardware, this error message can also result from driver conflicts and missing Windows updates that cause hardware to work or not work in unexpected ways.

 In some cases, overclocking can also cause this error to appear due to the extra strain overclocking puts on your CPU.

## How to Fix a WHEA Uncorrectable Error

 Since most WHEA uncorrectable errors are caused by hardware failure, fixing this error usually involves tracking down the problem component and replacing it. However, the best place to start is on the software end because that's easier and less expensive.

 In general, you'll want to start by checking for Windows and driver updates, then running checks on components like your hard drive and memory.

1. [Use Windows Update to make sure that your system is up to date](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . If you don't have automatic updates turned on or an automatic update failed for some reason, you might be missing a crucial patch. To make sure you're all up to date, type "**Windows Update** " into your taskbar search field.  
 If you require any updates, you'll have the option to install them. You can also select**Check for updates** to be sure.
2. Physically inspect your computer hardware. You may have a physical defect or failure in one of your hardware components. Some things to look for include whether your cooling system is hooked up and functional, your RAM is securely seated in place, components like your CPU haven't come loose, and everything is securely connected.  
 Don't touch anything inside your computer unless you're using an anti-static bracelet.
3. [Make sure your drivers are up to date](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Driver conflicts represent one of the most common causes of the WHEA uncorrectable error. If you're having a driver problem, it can be challenging to track down exactly which driver needs an update.  
 Use this[list of free driver updater tools](https://www.lifewire.com/free-driver-updater-tools-2619206) for some much-needed assistance.
4. [Use System Restore to undo any recent changes to your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you cannot track down the change that causes your system to start experiencing WHEA uncorrectable errors, a system restore may fix the problem. It's a utility that allows you to restore your system to an earlier state, which effectively undoes any changes made in the meantime.  
 If you try steps 1 & 2 above before you try this step, you may lose any updates you may have installed since, presumably, the restore point you use will be before these updates.
5. [Check for hard drive issues with the Error Checking utility](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-scan-a-hard-drive-using-error-checking-2624497) . Since the WHEA uncorrectable error can be caused by faulty hardware, running the Error Checking utility may help point you to the root cause of your problem. This utility works a lot like chkdsk, and it will let you know if there are any problems with your hard drive.  
 You can also use[chkdsk](https://www.lifewire.com/chkdsk-command-2625838) if you prefer. It doesn't have a graphical interface like the Error Checking utility, but it does provide a lot of additional options.
6. [Use a free memory diagnostic tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) . Faulty[RAM/memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) is another hardware issue that can cause the WHEA uncorrectable error, and the easiest way to check for this is with a free memory diagnostic tool. If one of these tools says you have bad memory,[replacing your RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) may eliminate your WHEA uncorrectable error.
7. [Disable overclocking in BIOS or UEFI](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-settings-831400) . To easily[access your system BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-enter-bios-2624481) or[UEFI](https://www.lifewire.com/unified-extensible-firmware-interface-833069) to undo any overclocking changes you've made, type "**Settings** " into your taskbar search field, then navigate to**Update & Security** \>**Recovery** \>**Advanced startup** \>**Restart now** .  
 The restart process will start. Select**Troubleshoot** \>**Advanced options** \>**UEFI Firmware Settings** . If your computer uses BIOS instead of UEFI, these options will be slightly different.  
 Your computer will restart and automatically open UEFI or BIOS. Navigate to the overclocking section, and disable all overclocking.  
 This fix only applies if your system has been overclocked. If you bought your computer new and never overclocked it, this fix doesn't apply.
8. [Reset Windows as a last resort](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-this-pc-complete-walkthrough-2624538) . When all else fails, reset Windows. It's an irreversible process that essentially reinstalls Windows from scratch and gives you a clean slate.  
 If you reset Windows and still experience the WHEA uncorrectable error, you have a hardware issue. Carefully inspect your hardware again, and seek professional assistance if you can't determine which piece of hardware has failed.
