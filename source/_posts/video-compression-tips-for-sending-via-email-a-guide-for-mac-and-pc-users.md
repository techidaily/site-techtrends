##  Do You Know the File-Size Caps on Mail Services? 

The biggest grumble about email is that there is file size limit imposed by each mail provider. The maximum video size for emailing via Gmail and Yahoo is 25MB. Apple Mail and Outlook let you attach and send a video file that is no bigger than 20Mb. 

Certainly, you can extend your video file size limit to up to 10 Gb by relying on Mail Drop, Google Drive, Dropbox. But things seem to get even worse as the time it takes to upload or download the video attachment is so long. While zip programs such as WinZip, [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/), Archive Utility, though allowing you to shrink video by zipping the video file, slow down computer when working with 3 or more videos at the same time. Here is a favorable turn. You can compress video for email to minimize the problems. But how to compress video size for email with no quality loss to much smaller file size and format email services accept? Follow the ways below.

## Part 1\. How to Compress Video for Email with Desktop Software 

[**MacX Video Converter Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) enables you to reduce large videos, especially the 4K and HD videos that excessively extends the email attachment limits, in ways of compressing 4K UHD to 1080p, FHD 1080p to 720p, converting in MKV, HEVC, H.264, M2TS, etc to smaller-sized video format like FLV, WMV, AVI, and shrinking video via parameter adjusting , including bitrate, frame rate, etc. 

What's more, you can use the video editing feature, e.g., to cut out unwanted video clips (reduce video length); crop the edges of videos (shrink the video frame size) for email with smaller attachment size. Needless to worry about the video quality because High Quality Engine guarantees an untouched video quality for you guys. 

The best part is[MacX uniquely supports level-3 hardware acceleration](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), powered by Intel QSV, Nvidia CUDA/NVENC, and AMD, to dramatically enhance the video processing speed, especially the 4K/8K UHD that asks for high demand on computer hardware.

**Best video format for Email:**  
 Except for the video size limits, providers also specify the video format for each email service in such a way transferring and attaching videos will be more efficient. Here is the most welcomed video format. 

**\* MP4:** It features the widest compatibility and keeps a good balance between video size and quality. It is supported by both Mac and Windows platforms and playable on almost all media players, smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, tvs, etc. MP4 manages to output video in a smaller size but the video quality isn't degraded too much. If you wanna compress video formatted MKV, FLV, WMV, MTS etc. for email, select "MP4 Video" from the "Output Profile" drop-up menu. This is the premium choice to send video over email.

**Step 3**.

 **\* For Frame rate:** Retain the frame rate unchanged in order to make sure the video playback goes smooth. Or else, mosaic appears.

 **\* For bitrate:** Please DO NOT decrease the bitrate too much. Video quality will be dramatically degraded along with the bitrate. Properly, **20-50% bitrate reduction** can ensure a good video size shrinking with a high level of quality your eyes won't make any distinguish.

## Part 3\. How to Shrink Video Size for Emailing with Apps 

**\* Downsize video for Email on iOS** 

Video Compressor helps users reduce large file size for sending email on iPhone iPad iPod by trimming video and changing FHD to 720p resolution. A new video folder is created automatically, so users won't mix it up with the original video file. But the app only compresses video in 720p VGA low resolution for emailing. You can download the app on iTunes store for free. 

**\* Compress video for Email on Android** 

The app gives you opportunities to resize video to send in email on Samsung, HTC and more Android mobile devices with ease. The App accepts videos in MP4, 3GP and AVI, which means that users can only decrease video size for email in these three formats. Also, it supports you to share the compressed zipped video file for email on Gmail on Android directly. It is free. However, there are too many pop-up ads. It takes along time and the output video resolution is a bit low. Anyway, app delivers poorer performance than others for email did.
