## How to Get Deleted Numbers Back on a Samsung Phone

 It's easy to recover deleted contacts on a Samsung phone because there's a handy recycle bin area that stores this information. You have 30 days to get a deleted phone number back before it disappears forever. Here's how:

1. Go to**Settings** \>**Battery and device care** \>**Storage** .
2. From the**Recycle bin** section, tap**Contacts** .
3. Select a contact from the list and tap**Restore** .

 Although it's not as common, your phone might have contacts stored on the internal memory or a SIM card. This can happen if that's where you've backed up your contacts. If you're lucky, the deleted number might still exist in the backup. Here's how to import those contacts:

1. Go to**Contacts** \>**Menu** \>**Manage Contacts.**  
![The Samsung Contacts app with the menu and 'Manage contacts' highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hGdu49Zvk3-BMwVJhDJRUg3hUkc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RetrieveDeletedNumbers06-ac12a6b7ae344c169bc47cddcde5b324.jpg)
2. Tap**Import or export contacts** \>**Import** . If you have any contacts stored on your SIM card or your internal memory, you'll see those sources in the list.
