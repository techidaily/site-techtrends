## Facebook Engagement Insights: Tracking Who Has Shared Your Content Online

Close 

###  What to Know

* Select the**bell** icon to see all your notifications, which includes who shared your Facebook post.
* Or, check the original post. Above the Like and Comment buttons, select the share count (e.g.,**2 shares** ).

 This article explains two easy ways to see your share stats on Facebook, including how many shares your post has received and who has shared it. Instructions apply to desktop and mobile users.

## Check Your Notifications 

 If you recently posted something, the easiest way to see if it's been shared is to check your notifications. Select the**alarm** /**bell** icon in the top right corner of Facebook or[ open the Notifications page](https://www.facebook.com/notifications) . Find the alert that mentions your post and you'll see who shared it and when.

## Check the Original Post 

 Your profile is another place you can look to see how many times your Facebook post has been shared and who shared it. Here's how it works from the Facebook website:

1. Visit your profile and scroll until you find the post you're curious about.  
 If it's not a recent post, you can find it through a[ Facebook search](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-search-guide-to-searching-facebook-2654608) . Search for a word or phrase from the original post and then, on the left-hand side of the results, select**Posts From** and choose**You** to see your earlier post.
2. Find the space between the post contents and the comment section, right above the Like, Comment, and Share buttons. Your post has been shared if you see the text**1 share** ,**2 shares** , etc.

3. Select**share** /**shares** to see who shared the post and any other information the person included when they shared it.

##  How to See Who Shared Someone Else's Post 

 It's just as easy to see who shared a post created by someone else. You'll notice that the same**share** link is available on the right side of the post. Click it to see the list of people who have shared the post. 

 Depending on the person's privacy settings, you might not see everyone who has shared the post.

 FAQ

* If someone blocked me, will they see my post if their friend shared it?  
 Once you've been blocked by someone, nothing you post or share will be visible to them no matter who else may share it. The only way they would see one of your posts is if a mutual friend posted their own screenshot of the original.
* How do I remove posts shared from my Facebook page?  
 You can't delete a specific post of yours that's been shared by someone else, but you can delete the original post. In the upper-right corner of the post, select the**three dots** to find the option to trash the post. Any reposts or shares will become blank.
