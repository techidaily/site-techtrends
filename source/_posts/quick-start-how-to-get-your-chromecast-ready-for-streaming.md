 Note: If you want to upgrade DirectX further, you’ll need to upgrade your operating system.

 If Windows Update fails to update your DirectX for you, you can try to install the update manually.

## Install DirectX End-User Runtime

 As the error message suggested: **DX11 feature level 10.0 is required to run the engine** , you should install the latest DirectX in your Windows to support the game.

 To do so, you need to install the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35&msclkid=925e9033c66c11ec8cedbba96a57a2fb](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35&msclkid=925e9033c66c11ec8cedbba96a57a2fb)

 Click the**Download** button, then run the execution file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the installer.

 Then download DirectX Redist from here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) . After the download, double-click the downloaded file and extract it to wherever you prefer. When the file is extracted, double-click the **DXSetup** file to run the DirectX files installation.
