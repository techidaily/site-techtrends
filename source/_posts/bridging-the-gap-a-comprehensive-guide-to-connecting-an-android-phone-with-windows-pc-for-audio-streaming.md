##  Download AudioRelay on Your Phone and Computer

 To get started, download the AudioRelay app on your phone and computer. To install the app on your computer, visit the [official AudioRelay website](https://audiorelay.net/downloads), download AudioRelay for Windows, and run the setup file to install it. AudioRelay automatically downloads the necessary drivers, so no manual installation is needed.

 Next, open the Google Play Store on your phone, find the [AudioRelay app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2001556/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azefsw.audioconnect), and install it. Once that's done, you can use your phone as a speaker through the app in two ways: Wi-Fi or USB tethering. Choose the method that suits you best.

##  Use Your Phone as a Speaker Via Wi-Fi

 This method requires your phone and computer to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If they share the same connection, open the AudioRelay app on your computer and [locate your computer's IP address](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-infinix-note-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) in the app's top-right corner.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Then, launch the app on your phone, enter your computer's IP address in the field under "Connect by Address," and tap "Connect."

 After that, navigate to the desktop app, expand the Audio Device menu, and select "Virtual Speakers" from the available audio output devices list.

 This will establish the connection, turning your phone into a speaker for your computer.

##  Use Your Phone as a Speaker Via USB Tethering

 If a Wi-Fi connection isn't available, you can use USB tethering to turn your smartphone into an audio output device for your computer. First, [connect your phone to the computer using a USB cable](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-ways-to-remove-ssgnature-backdrops-fast/). Then, enable USB tethering in the AudioRelay app and Android settings.

 Launch the AudioRelay app on your Android device, go to the "Settings" tab, and toggle the switch next to USB Tethering to enable it.

 To activate USB tethering on your phone, open the "Settings" app, go to Connections > Mobile Hotspot and Tethering, and toggle on the switch next to USB Tethering.

![Enabling USB Tethering in the Settings of an Android Phone.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/usb-tethering.png) 

 Once USB tethering is activated, launch the app on your phone. It should automatically detect your computer and display it in the Servers section. If it doesn't detect it automatically, open the desktop app and note the IP address in the top-right corner. Then, open the app on your phone, input this address into the "Connect by Address" field, and tap "Connect."

 That's it! Stream any audio on your PC and begin listening through your Android speakers!

##  Stop Using Your Phone as a Speaker

 To discontinue using your phone as an audio output device, open the app and tap the "Stop" button.

 Afterward, choose your system drivers from the Audio Device menu on your desktop app.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If the above steps don't activate your computer's built-in (or external) speakers, you may need to [manually change the default speakers from the sound settings](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/learn-the-process-of-capturing-your-watched-youtube-content-without-spending-for-2024/). Search for "Change System Sounds" in Windows Search and click "Open" to open the sound settings.

![Opening the sound settings from Windows Search.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/opening-the-sound-settings-from-windows-search-1.jpg) 

 Then, proceed to the "Playback" tab. If Virtual Speakers is set as the default here, right-click on your device's speakers and select "Set as Default Device." This should make Windows use the built-in (or external) speakers for audio output.

 That's how your phone's speakers can save the day if your laptop speakers stop working. While AudioRelay makes this task simple, you can experiment with other apps that offer similar functionality with more customization options.
