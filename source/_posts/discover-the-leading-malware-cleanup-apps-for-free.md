 Google Calendar is an easy-to-use free online calendar that you can share with anyone.

 What We Like

* Syncs Google, Outlook, and Microsoft 365.
* Add two members to workspace.
* Multiple calendar views.
* Event scheduling.

 What We Don't Like

* Some limitations with free account.
* Limited to one connected calendar at a time.

 While the paid versions of the simply named Calendar program appeal to businesses and larger teams, the free tier offers a lot of the most useful features for individuals.

 The streamlined online calendar, also available for Android and iOS, allows you to connect one calendar from either Google, Outlook, or Microsoft 365\. If you want to integrate more than one external calendar simultaneously, you'll have to upgrade.

 You can also create your own calendar within the app and invite one other member to join the workspace and collaborate, including participating in meetingsâ€”through there's a limit of five events annually. The two-seat limitation might be restrictive for some, but for a couple or two friends, this option could be ideal.

 Calendar isn't flashy, but it offers color coding, multiple calendar views (daily, weekly, and monthly), a unified view for all calendars, and a Zapier integration for all account levels, which adds another perk for free users.
