## Most Effective Tools & Applications to Optimize Your Twitter Experience

Close 

 There are many types of[ social media management tools](https://www.lifewire.com/social-media-apps-for-managing-everything-3486302) . The most useful X (formerly Twitter) management tool is called a client or dashboard. It's designed to replace X's one-column display of tweets with more powerful ways to read, send, and manage tweets.

##  Software Download vs. No Download

 One difference among the various X client and dashboard programs is whether they require a software download and installation on your computer, or if they run through an internet browser and require no downloads. Also, some X client tools allow you to manage other social media networks and services.

 Increasingly, X is making changes to its site to make it more useful. Still, the X homepage isn't as powerful as the top independent X clients listed in this article.

 What We Like

* Multiple columns of tweets.
* You can schedule tweets.
* Can save keyword searches.

 What We Don't Like

* Can't edit your tweets.
* Very limited customization.

 X Pro (formerly TweetDeck) was so popular that[ Twitter bought it in May 2011](https://money.cnn.com/2011/05/23/technology/twitter%5Facquires%5Ftweetdeck/index.htm) and continues to develop it as a X client. TweetDeck was originally free, but you'll have to pay for a subscription for X Pro.

 The X website and app display only one column of tweets, which makes for a slower reading experience. For this reason, many people prefer using a client such as X Pro as their main way to view tweets.

 X Pro lets you set up groups of people to follow, and it displays your feeds or streams in rows of columns, so you can view several posts at once.

 It also lets you save keyword searches and view them in one of many column displays. In the other columns, you can see streams from the groups you set up, posts containing hashtags you want to follow, and feeds from your other X accounts.

 X Pro doesn't work on mobile devices, but you can view it on a screen with a resolution of more than 500px in width and 500px in height.

## [ Hootsuite](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hootsuite-3486042)

![Hootsuite](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NuehpXT8nkQBhfbCdbteyhyTeB0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/hootsuite-0fe10e09dccd40b4a7857061cf6fe683.jpg) 

 What We Like

* You can schedule posts.
* Amazing analytics.
* Excellent customer service.
* No download required.

 What We Don't Like

* Boring layout.
* Must pay to use some apps.

 Hootsuite is one of the top two free clients for managing X. Unlike TweetDeck, Hootsuite requires no software download because it is an internet-based X client, which means it's accessible on all web browsers.

 Like TweetDeck, Hootsuite displays the tweets you subscribed to in columns or lists for quick viewing. This quick-view function allows you to see several tweet streams at once and interact with them in more powerful ways.

 As with most X clients or dashboards, you can retweet, reply, direct message, follow, or unfollow from drop-down menus or icons alongside any tweet.

 One of the best things about Hootsuite is that it can manage more than your X timelines. From the same dashboard window, Hootsuite also manages your feeds and profiles on Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social networks. Hootsuite is a social media client in addition to an X client.

 Hootsuite's basic service is free, but it also offers premium monthly subscriptions for those who need to manage more than three social media accounts, or if you need more than one user to manage your social media accounts.
