If you're a California resident, your digital wallet just got a little thicker.

Apple [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-brings-california-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-to-apple-wallet/) that support for California digital IDs is here, meaning residents of the state can add their state IDs or California driver's licenses to [Apple Wallet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-add-your-drivers-license-to-your-iphone-wallet-app-depends-where-you-live/) and view it on their iPhone or [Apple Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/). Support for [Google Wallet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-google-wallet-and-why-you-should/) should be arriving soon.

**Also: [Google Wallet will let you digitize your US passport - and here's how to make one](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-wallet-will-let-you-digitize-your-us-passport-and-heres-how-to-do-it/)**

The rollout is a part of the California DMV's [mobile driver's license program](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/) which launched last year.

Select Circle K locations will take the mobile version of your driver's license, as will select apps and TSA screenings at San Francisco International Airport, San Jose Mineta International Airport, and Los Angeles International Airport.

You're still required to carry your physical license (as required by law), but the digital version should make identity and age verification a lot faster. 

**Also: [One of the best wallet AirTags I've tested isn't made by Apple](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/one-of-the-best-wallet-airtags-ive-tested-isnt-made-by-apple-or-tile/)**

A digital driver's license copy isn't exactly new territory for California, as it has its own [CA DMV Wallet](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/) app which essentially does the same thing (500,000 of the state's 39 million residents have enrolled in this app). What's new is having your license in the same app you might use for, say, storing a boarding pass at the airport and a payment card to grab a coffee once you're inside or for age verification when buying alcohol and then a card to pay.

If you're concerned about security, the DMV has stated it does not permanently retain any of your personal data, other than your phone number and an encrypted photo of your license or ID card. The DMV also says that how you use your mobile license isn't tracked and no data will leave your device without your consent.

## How to add your California driver's license to Google Wallet

* From your Google Wallet home screen, tap the plus sign in the bottom right corner that says "Add to Wallet."
* You'll see a list of cards and passes that Wallet supports. Choose "ID card" and then "Get Started" on the next screen.
* Choose from the list of supported states. Right now, that's only Arizona, California, Georgia, and Maryland.
* Wallet will verify your info with CA DMV, a process that might take a few minutes.
* You'll be asked to use your iPhone to scan your physical driver's license or state ID card and take a selfie plus a series of facial and head movements.
