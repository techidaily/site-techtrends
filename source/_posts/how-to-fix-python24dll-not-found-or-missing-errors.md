 In some cases, python24.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 The python24.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including ​[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Python24.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.  

 Do not download python24.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore python24.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" python24.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the following steps, if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some python24.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Install Python 2.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4/) for a legitimate python24.dll download. This is the original source of the python24.dll file and, therefore, the best place to download it.  
 After Python is installed, you can find the python24 DLL file in this folder:  
 `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\`
4. [Reinstall the program that uses the python24.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the python24.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step even if you've already installed Python 2.4\. Reinstalling the program that provides the python24.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error since the installer will know exactly where the DLL file should go.
5. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer.  
 While the python24.dll file probably isn't included in one of those updates, an update from Microsoft might provide the prerequisite for the python24 DLL file to work properly.
6. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair python24.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid python24.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
