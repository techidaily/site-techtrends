## How to Fix Error Code 0x80004005

 Follow these steps in the order presented to troubleshoot error code 0x80004005:

1. [Run the Windows Update troubleshooter](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter) . The error can happen when an automatic Windows Update fails, or when files downloaded by Windows Update are corrupted. On Windows 7 or later, the easiest[way to fix problems with Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-problems-caused-by-windows-updates-2625775) is to run the built-in automatic troubleshooter.
2. Delete everything in the Windows Update download folder. If the automatic troubleshooter does not fix the problem, open Windows[File Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-file-manager-4589189) and navigate to**C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution** , for Windows 11 or**C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download** for earlier Windows versions, then delete everything inside the folder.
3. [Run Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . If the problem is related to Windows Update, you may have to finish downloading and installing updates. After running the troubleshooter and manually deleting the files in the Windows Update folder, run Windows Update again.
4. [Delete temporary files](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-temporary-files-in-windows-2624709) . In some cases, a corrupt temporary file can cause error 0x80004005\. Use the Windows Disk Cleanup tool or type**%temp%** in the Windows search bar to find the**Temp** folder and delete everything inside it.
5. [Disable Outlook mail notifications](https://www.lifewire.com/configure-outlook-email-notifications-1173647) . The error code can occur when[Microsoft Outlook](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-outlook-4164620) attempts to notify you of new messages. If disabling this feature fixes the problem, then try[starting Outlook in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/outlook-safe-mode-4164302) . If that works, a simple re-install might fix your problem.
6. [Disable Windows Defender](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-windows-defender-4165378) . In some cases,[antivirus](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-antivirus-software-152947) software can detect a false positive in connection with the Microsoft Outlook app. If you experience error code 0x80004005 when using Microsoft Outlook, and disabling notifications did not help, turning off antivirus software may fix the problem. Also,[disable Norton Antivirus](https://www.lifewire.com/disable-norton-antivirus-4589389) and other third-party antivirus programs you use.  
 Disabling antivirus software leaves the system vulnerable to malware. Try different[free antivirus programs](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-antivirus-software-4151895) to find one that doesn't conflict with the applications you use.
7. [Use a different unzip program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-unzip-programs-1356643) . If you see the error code when extracting or opening compressed files (like[.zip](https://www.lifewire.com/zip-file-2622675) or[.rar](https://www.lifewire.com/rar-file-2622216) files), use a different extraction tool.
8. Re-register jdscript.dll and vbscript.dll. If you still see error 0x80004005 after trying to unzip files with other extraction tools, then re-registering these two[dynamic link libraries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) (DLLs) may help.  
[Open the Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) as an administrator, type**regsvr32 jscript.dll** , then press the**Enter** key. Then, type**regsvr32 vbscript.dll** and press**Enter** .
9. [Add a key to the Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-change-delete-registry-keys-values-2625145) . If you suspect error 0x80004005 in conjunction with copying or moving files,[open the Windows Registry Editor](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-registry-editor-2625150) and go to **HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System** .  
   * On a[32-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/32-bit-64-bit-2624554) system, create a new**DWORD** [registry value](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-value-2626042) called**LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy** .  
   * On a 64-bit system, create a**QWORD** registry value called**LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy** .  
 In both cases, set the value to**numeric 1** (on), then select**OK** . After that,[restart the Windows PC](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) to see if the problem is fixed.

 Don't delete or change anything in the Windows registry unless you know what you're doing.
10. Contact support. If none of these fixes work, or if you don't want to make changes to the Windows Registry, contact customer support for your Windows PC. The manufacturer may have potential solutions.
