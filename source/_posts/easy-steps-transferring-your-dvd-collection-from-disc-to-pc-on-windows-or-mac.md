You can't use Windows Media Player to copy files from DVD to PC computers on Windows 11/10/7\. Windows Media Player can only copy songs from an audio CD to your PC. 

**2\. How do I copy a DVD to my computer Windows 10?**

If you want to copy a DVD as a digital file on your PC, simply select one of the above tools for it, such as MacX DVD Ripper Pro, Handbrake, VLC, MakeMKV, etc. You can also use the built-in Windows Disc Image Burner tool to copy an un-protected DVD to PC in ISO:

* Insert the DVD into your computer's DVD drive. Open File Explorer and navigate to the DVD drive.
* Right-click on the DVD drive and select "Create a disc image."
* In the "Disc Image Burner" window, choose a location on your PC computer to save the DVD image file, select the file format you want (usually ISO), and click "Save."
* It will take a few minutes to create the ISO image file. Then you will get a digital copy of the DVD on your computer.

**3\. Can you save a DVD as a file on your computer?**

Yes, you can save a DVD as a file on your computer using specialized software that can rip the contents of the DVD to a digital file format. Whether you're running on Windows or macOS, this post have listed ways to download the video files from a DVD to your computer. 

**4\. How do I copy a DVD to my laptop without a CD drive?**

If your laptop doesn't have a CD/DVD drive, you can still copy the contents of a DVD to your laptop by using an external USB DVD drive or by creating an image file of the DVD on another computer that has a DVD drive and then transferring that file to your laptop.

**5\. Is it legal to rip a DVD I own to computer?**

The legality of ripping a DVD you own to a computer depends on the laws of your country. In some countries, it may be legal to make a backup copy of a DVD for personal use, while in others it may be considered copyright infringement.

In the United States, for example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) makes it illegal to bypass digital rights management (DRM) technologies used to protect DVDs, even if you own the physical disc. However, it's widely considered as legal to rip a DVD that a user legally purchased.

_Notice: The DVD ripper developer only encourages you to use this DVD ripper Mac version to rip and convert DVDs for legal personal use, instead of illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content. Please obey your local DVD copyright law before doing it. DO NOT do harm to others' lawful rights and interests._
