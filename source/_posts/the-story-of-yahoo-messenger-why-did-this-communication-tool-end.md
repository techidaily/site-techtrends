## The Story of Yahoo Messenger: Why Did This Communication Tool End?
 Yahoo Messenger was an instant messaging service from[Yahoo](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-yahoo-3483209) that was provided for mobile devices through the smartphone app and desktop users through the web and a software program.

 The service was shut down by Yahoo on July 17, 2018\. However, it isn't the only IM program available; there are lots of Yahoo Messenger alternatives that work in basically the same way.

Yahoo!

 The Yahoo Messenger app was much like other messaging apps. You could send free texts to your friends using the internet, and it worked on a variety of platforms. This meant you could install the app on your phone or tablet, or pull it up on your computer, to send free texts without paying for a texting service.

 Beyond text was support for other things, too, like GIFs, images, emoticons, and other files. As long as you had a valid internet connection, whether Wi-Fi or from a mobile data plan, you could communicate with friends and family absolutely free of charge.

 Lots of changes were made to Yahoo Messenger over the years. It was released in 1998 as Yahoo! Pager with a built-in chat room service before being renamed to its final moniker a year later.

 Features came and went, including the LAUNCHcast Radio plugin, in-chat YouTube streaming and gaming, VoIP, video calling, Yahoo! 360 integration, voicemail, Flickr support, and the ability to chat with Facebook friends.

## What Happened to Yahoo Messenger?

 It's not uncommon for services, including long-lasting ones like Yahoo Messenger, to reach an end. The company's goals evolve, too few users are signing up, competing services emerge, the company loses money, etc.

 Here's[Yahoo's explanation for the end of Yahoo Messenger](https://web.archive.org/web/20200516194426/https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN28776.html) :

> As the communications landscape continues to change, we're focused on building and introducing new, exciting communications tools that better fit consumer needs.

## Yahoo Messenger App Replacements

 Although Yahoo Messenger is dead, you're not without modern options. In fact, there are dozens upon dozens of apps you can use instead. For example,[Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) ,[Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) ,[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) , and[Signal](https://signal.org/) are all fine options that are still in active development.

 The replacement you choose should depend on what you want it to do. For example, there are lots of ways to[call someone using just an app](https://www.lifewire.com/free-internet-phone-calls-1356646) . Or maybe you're wanting to[make free video calls from your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/apps-for-free-video-chat-3426695) .

 Most messaging apps actually include all those features; they let you make audio and video calls, send and receive texts, and share files. Some, like Facebook Messenger, are more closely related to Yahoo Messenger than others and can run from your phone/tablet, computer, and a web browser.

 Yahoo introduced its own alternative to Yahoo Messenger in 2018, initially called Yahoo! Squirrel and then Yahoo Together. However, it was shut down, too, just a year later.

 Yahoo is still very much alive, so you can still use your account for other things like accessing Yahoo Mail.
