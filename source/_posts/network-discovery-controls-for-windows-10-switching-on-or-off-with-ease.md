## What Does Windows 10 Network Discovery Mean?

 Network discovery refers to your computer’s ability to connect with and be found by nearby devices. To turn on network discovery means to make your device discoverable and connectable. When you turn off network discovery, you disable this feature, essentially protecting your computer by making it invisible.

 If you want to work offline, you don't need to deal with the Windows 10 network discovery settings at all. Instead,[turn on airplane mode](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-and-android-airplane-modes-4148142) .

 You don't usually need to worry about turning on network discovery because Windows 10 will automatically switch between the two settings depending on your type of connection and the level of available security on the network.

 However, checking these settings can be helpful if you’re trying to connect to another device and can’t see it as an available connection option. They can also be worth checking if someone else can’t find your device, like when you need to[connect a Microsoft Surface to another computer](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-microsoft-surface-to-another-computer-5115391) .
