iPhone 16

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

Well, it's like Christmas has come early, and Apple has finally lifted the lid on the long-awaited -- and much-leaked -- [iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and [iPhone 16 Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) lineup, the [Apple Watch Series 10](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and new [AirPods 4](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-4%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), so there's never been a better time to order any of these products. 

**Also: [How Apple just changed hearing aids forever - and the lives of those who need them](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-just-changed-hearing-aids-forever-and-the-lives-of-those-who-need-them)**

The [new iPhone 16 models](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) bring significant upgrades, including enhanced AI capabilities and improved hardware features. The next-generation [Apple Watches](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) offer feature new health and fitness tracking capabilities, along with a revamped version of watchOS.

However, in an interesting turn of events, rather than updating the [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-ultra-2%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and the [AirPods Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), Apple has given this hardware a new lease of life by [adding new features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-4-biggest-new-health-features-apple-just-announced/) such as sleep apnea detection for the Ultra 2 and a [clinical hearing aid feature](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-just-changed-hearing-aids-forever-and-the-lives-of-those-who-need-them) for the AirPods Pro. 

That leaves some spare money to buy one of those [titanium Milanese bands](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMXKC3AM%2FA%2F49mm-natural-titanium-milanese-loop-small&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) for your Apple Watch Ultra 2\.

For those in need of tablets for work or that [back-to-school frenzy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-for-college/), Apple has addressed -- for the most part -- the great iPad wasteland, updating the [iPad Air](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-air&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) with M2 silicon, and fitting the [iPad Pro models](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) with its [new M4 chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-ipad-pros-new-outrageously-powerful-m4-chip-designed-for-ai-workloads/). The [iPad](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) now also features an updated price tag -- everything else remains the same -- so that's back on the menu, but be aware that you're still buying hardware released in October 2022.

Beyond that, Apple's lineup seems pretty strong, from the [M3 MacBook Air systems](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) to the [14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F16-inch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) powered by the [M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-chipsets-everything-you-need-to-know/) (but still no M3 Ultra... yet).

## **The 'Naughty' list**

Don't buy these devices:

* **iPad Mini**: [Released in September 2021](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/), this tablet's age is worth keeping in mind. Two and a half years is a long time in tech. Would you pay full price for an [iPhone 13](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-iphone-13/), which was released at the same time? No, you wouldn't.
* **iPhone SE**: Apple [released this handset in March 2022](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/) and rumor has it there won't be another one. Other rumors say the next one will launch this year, or sometime in 2025\. We'll see.
* **Mac Studio**: The M2-powered Mac Studio is no longer the beast it was, and given that it's over a year old and running on previous-generation silicon, I suggest giving it a miss and getting a [MacBook Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) instead.
* **Apple TV**: Last updated in October 2022, this device is due for a refresh, possibly alongside the iPhone, so unless you desperately need a new one, wait a few months.

From a Camera Control button, an Action button, and the new [A18 chipset](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-apples-new-a18-chipsets-make-the-iphone-16-models-worth-upgrading-to/), the [iPhone 16](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) has been built from the ground up to handle AI workloads.

### **Apple Watch Series 10**

Apple Watch Series 10

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

The [Apple Watch Series 10](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) starts at $399 for GPS and $499 for cellular. It comes in three colors: jet black, rose gold, and silver aluminum. The new black [Apple Watch Ultra 2](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch%2Fapple-watch-ultra&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) starts at $799\. 

### **Apple M3 MacBook Air**

Apple MacBook Air M3

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Apple's MacBook Air has an M3 chip -- more oomph to tackle heavier-duty AI tasks. 

**Review: [M3 MacBook Air: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/)**

Along with the updated processor, this MacBook Air can also power two external monitors with the lid closed, making it a great desktop replacement -- just add two screens! 

With prices for the [13-inch M3 MacBook Air starting at $1,099](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2F13-inch-midnight-apple-m3-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-8gb-memory-256gb&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and the [15-inch version starting at $200 more](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2F15-inch-midnight-apple-m3-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-8gb-memory-256gb&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), these systems represent some serious processing power for an extremely competitive price (especially when you consider these are Apple laptops). 

### **Apple Vision Pro**

Apple Vision Pro on a stand

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

[Apple's newest product](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-apples-vision-pro-price-features-hands-on-insights-and-everything-you-need-to-know/) is the company's foray into mixed-reality spatial computing. 

**Also: [10 reasons the Apple Vision Pro is secretly brilliant](https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-reasons-the-apple-vision-pro-is-secretly-brilliant/)**

It's hard to bet against Apple, but a futuristic set of goggles with a starting price of [$3,499](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-vision&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) doesn't feel like the easiest thing to sell. Still, Apple is Apple, and if any company can convince consumers to part with large sums of cash (and developers [to create apps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-vision-pro-will-launch-with-600-new-apps-built-just-for-the-headset/) for a new platform that could fall flat on its face), it's Apple.

### **Apple 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro**

This lineup of MacBooks has the entire lineup of M3 chips -- from the powerful M3 to the [insanely powerful M3 Max](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-chipsets-everything-you-should-know-before-buying/). Here are the specs:

* Powered by the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max chips
* Up to 22 hours of battery life
* 8GB to 128GB of unified memory
* 512GB to 8TB of SSD storage
* Liquid Retina XDR display
* Ports galore, with up to three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SDXC card slot, an HDMI port, a MagSafe 3 port, and a headphone jack

### **Apple's 24-inch iMac**

Apple [refreshed the iMac in October 2023](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-apple-announced-at-its-october-scary-fast-event-m3-macbook-pro-24-inch-imac-more/), and while it has the same 24-inch, 4.5K Retina display, it received the M3 chip upgrade. Here are the highlights:

* Apple M3 chip (no M3 Pro or M3 Max option)
* 24-inch 4.5K Retina display
* 8GB to 24GB of unified memory
* 512GB to 2TB of SSD storage
* Super-thin all-in-one desktop
* Seven vibrant colors

### **2nd-gen AirPods Pro (now with USB-C)**

Christina Darby/ZDNET

The [AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C4131e44b-58c1-432d-9851-261fb736bc95%7Cdtp&dtb=1) offers a major upgrade over the previous model, giving Apple's premium buds a massive lead over the competition. Apple has now refreshed the charging case to use USB-C rather than Lightning -- great if you have a new iPhone, but yet another cable or dongle to carry if not. Here are the highlights: 

* Active Noise Cancellation reduces unwanted background noise
* Adaptive Transparency lets outside sounds in while reducing loud environmental noise
* Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking places the sound all around you
* Multiple ear tips (XS, S, M, L)
* Touch control lets you swipe to adjust volume, press to direct media playback, answer or end calls, and press and hold to switch between listening modes
* Sweat- and water-resistant for AirPods Pro and charging case
* MagSafe Charging Case with a speaker and a lanyard loop
* USB-C charging

And soon, your AirPods Pro earbuds will be able to function as [clinical-grade hearing aids](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-just-changed-hearing-aids-forever-and-the-lives-of-those-who-need-them), bringing better hearing to tens of millions of people and disrupting the hearing aids market.
