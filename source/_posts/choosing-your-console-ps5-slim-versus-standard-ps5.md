## Choosing Your Console: PS5 Slim Versus Standard PS5

 Updates to PlayStation consoles in the middle of their lifecycle are practically a tradition, and Sony's PlayStation 5 is no different.

 The[ new slim models](https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-slim-7966360) are smaller and lighter, and they can play all the same PS5 and PS4 games that the launch models can run. Like the launch model, the PS5 Slim comes in two versions: one with a 4K Blu-Ray disc drive and the other a digital edition. The latter can use a detachable 4K Blu-Ray disc drive.

 But is the PS5 Slim ultimately much of an upgrade? Technically, no, but whether it is worth it depends on your shelf space.

##  Features: PS5 Slim Sizes Down

 Overall, the PS5 Slim takes up 30% less space than the PS5\. The PS5 Slim and PS5 Slim Digital Edition are 18% and 24% lighter than the launch model. Compared to the PS5's two cover panels, the PS5 Slim has four cover panels, and the top ones have a glossy surface.

 Technical differences are minor — the PS5 Slim SSD has 1 TB in storage space compared to the PS5's 825GB SSD. The Slim also has two front-facing USB-C ports instead of the original model's one USB-C port in the front. However, the original does have a front-mounted USB-A port that isn't present on the Slim models.

###  PS5 Slim Gets a New Stand

 The original PS5 came with a stand that could hold the console vertically and horizontally. The PS5 Slim, however, only comes with a couple of feet that let the console sit horizontally.

 Sony sells a newly designed vertical stand separately for $29.99, which works with all PS5 models.

[ View on Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/Vertical-Stand-PS5%C2%AE-Consoles-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5GJDVY?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8643357%7Cn68a0e8bd510540dfa0f7b52f42ea4c9a12%7C) 

##  Disc Drives: PS5 Slim's Is Removable

 Owners of the PS5 Slim can remove the bottom panels and detach the 4K Blu-Ray disc drive. Those with the PS5 Slim Digital Edition can attach a disc drive later, but it's a separate purchase of $79.99.

 The cost of purchasing a Digital Edition console and a detachable disc drive exceeds the price of a regular PS5 Slim, so getting the disc edition is more sensible if you intend to play using physical game discs.

##  Final Thoughts: Is the PS5 Slim an Upgrade?

 The PS5 Slim is not a radical upgrade from the original PS5\. Its most defining feature is its compact form factor, but otherwise, the PS5 Slim has identical functionality and hardware specifications as the launch PS5.

 If you don't yet own a PS5 and want to purchase one for yourself or someone else, the PS5 Slim is the best option — and will be the only option in stores once the original consoles sell.

 However, owners of the[ launch PS5](https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394) should be OK with their current console, provided it has no issues and its bulky body already fits fine in their current setup.
