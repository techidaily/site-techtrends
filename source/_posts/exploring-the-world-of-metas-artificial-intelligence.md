## Who Built Meta AI? 

 Meta AI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory owned by Meta Platforms Inc. It was founded in 2015 as Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and later renamed when Facebook, Inc. rebranded as Meta Platforms, Inc. The team behind the chatbot includes researchers and engineers who work on machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and other areas of AI research.

 Meta AI's unique language model is called[ Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/) ; it's open-source and freely available. The company positions it as a competitor to ChatGPT and Google Gemini, with several features custom-designed for the popular apps you use.

## What Can Meta AI Do? 

 Meta AI is similar to generative multi-modal chatbots like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. But uniquely, it also works with Google and Bing for real-time search.

 Meta AI works across feeds, chats, and searches on all of the company's social platforms. It can work as a simple productivity app to get things done; as a search engine to find answers and recommendations; or to produce images, stickers, and animated GIFs with its image generation prompts. All messages are end-to-end encrypted.

 The chatbot also combines Meta AI with Emu, the video and image generation model. You can easily generate images directly in messages or group chats with a prompt. For instance, Emu's capabilities let you take a photo and change its visual style or background with a few prompts.

 Running on Llama 3, it can handle complex tasks like translation and conversations. The language model is powerful and can easily manage many steps. The improved training methods in the latest version make it better at giving accurate and more varied answers. The developers claim that it also has better capabilities in reasoning, creating code, and following instructions.

## How Can You Use Meta AI? 

 If you live in the U.S. or any supported country, you can use Meta AI in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and[ on the web](https://www.meta.ai/) .

 Meta AI, as a conversational chatbot, is easy to use. Here's an example on Instagram:

 You're planning a beach trip with friends in an[ Instagram Group chat](https://www.lifewire.com/make-instagram-group-chat-5704891) . Use the search field and Meta AI's auto-suggestions to find the perfect beach for everyone. At the end of the day, describe your beach day with keywords (surfboard, palm trees, etc) and ask it to draw an image. Meta AI whips up a memorable photo for the whole group in the chat.
