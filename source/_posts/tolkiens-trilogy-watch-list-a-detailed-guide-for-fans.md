## Change Your Discord Icon Easily: Detailed Instructions Inside
### What to Know

* Desktop: Open your account settings and select the image. Click the plus sign next to your profile picture and select a new image.
* Mobile: Go to the settings, choose**My Account** , tap the image, choose a source, and then select a new image.
* Note: There are limits on how often you can change your avatar image for security purposes.

 This article covers how to upload a new avatar on[Discord](https://www.lifewire.com/discord-4174046) using the desktop app, browser, and mobile apps.

## How to Update Your Discord Avatar

 The process for adding or updating your profile picture is the same in a browser and the app. You can also remove the image; Discord doesn't require one.

 Discord places limits on changing an avatar image. Users can make no more than two attempts within 10 minutes to prevent people from trying to circumvent Discord's terms of service.

1. Open the app on PC or Mac.
2. Click settings cog at the bottom left next to the current image.

3. Select the three-dotted menu to the right of where the image goes.

## How to Update Your Discord Image on Mobile

 The process for changing your avatar via the Discord mobile app is similar. The screenshots below are from Android, but the process is the same on an iPhone, just with a different look. Again, you can remove your avatar altogether if you don't want one.

1. Open the app on an Android or iPhone.
2. Tap your profile image on the bottom right.
3. Tap**My Account** .
4. Select the image or image placeholder. Tap**Remove Icon** to delete your profile image.

5. If this is the first time you've uploaded a profile picture, Discord will ask you for two permissions: to access your camera and your photos and videos. Tap**Allow** or**While using the app** on at least one of these options to proceed.
