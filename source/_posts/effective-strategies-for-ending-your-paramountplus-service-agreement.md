## Discover the Most Popular and Effective Samsung Smart TV Apps of 2E – Upgrade Your Home Cinema Now

Hundreds of Samsung apps for Samsung Smart TVs are available, but which are the best must-have apps?

 You get the obvious streaming video apps with Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Hulu included on Smart TVs, but there are many other TV apps out there. You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 Our Top Picks

## The Roku Channel

![Roku Channel Example – Samsung Smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XCuRBK6nHpBdYPRunf9aw5MDXp8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-roku-channel-samsung-example-1700-zzz-4b576b313fbc448a951648b958e68dbf.jpg)

 What We Like

* 24/7 Live News from ABC and Newsy.
* Live Sports from Stadium.
* Lots of Free Movies and TV Shows.
* New movies and TV shows added weekly.

 What We Don't Like

* Content has Ads.
* Movies and TV shows are not the most current.
* No 4K content.
* May only be available on 2015 and newer Samsung Smart TV models.

 Roku is well-known for its[streaming sticks, boxes, and smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) , but it also offers a streaming app for other devices, including select Samsung TVs. The Roku Channel provides a mix of free content accessible through a "Netflix-like" onscreen interface for Samsung TVs that includes live news and sports, as well as past hit movies and TV shows.

You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

* Built-in rating system.
* Decent selection of free movies to watch.

 What We Don't Like

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content. You can rent many movies for $4.99, usually with a 48-hour viewing window. Content offerings, some in HDR, change periodically. You need only a 4mbps to 5mbps broadband speed.

![Facebook Watch Example](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lto8CDcczmgcip1oebsofD1NeDg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/facebook-watch-exmaple-1-c8f2085c1ff449019c3cfa04b4b4870c.jpg)

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

 Like YouTube and Instagram Video, Facebook Watch lets you watch user-generated videos on your big-screen Samsung TV. The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more. You can also watch a lot of live news feeds from sources such as the LA Times, Bloomberg, and ABC News, as well as live gaming and some live sports.

![Homepage of HBO Max ](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JXU4WQvhBT7yBrok3XB1YxTHxSw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HBOmax-46e80682131e4d1f80354e131b5d1ea7.jpg)

 What We Like

* No cable or satellite subscription required.
* Access to all HBO programming and movies.
* Low cost if you can live with limited ads on a basic subscription.

 What We Don't Like

* Although cable subscription isn't required, you still have to pay a subscription fee via the app.
* Doesn't duplicate HBO's live cable feed.
* Need a premium subscription to view content ad-free.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .
