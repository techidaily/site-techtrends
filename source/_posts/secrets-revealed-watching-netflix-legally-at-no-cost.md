 The MacBook Pro with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max were announced on October 30, 2023\. The M3 and M3 Pro models were made available to order on October 30, 2023 with a release date of November 7, while the M3 Max was scheduled to be available in November 2023.

## M3 MacBook Pro Prices

 The 14" M3 MacBook Pro starts at $1599 (a $400 price cut), and the 16" MacBook Pro starts at $2499\. The price goes up depending on which version of M3 you use, along with storage and RAM options, each of which will add at least $200 to the price.

## Order Information

 Only 2 of the 3 models were made available to order on October 30\. The M3 Max shipped in late November. You can[order directly from Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) .

## M3 MacBook Pro Features and Specs

 There are three levels of MacBook Pro systems in two sizes: 14- and 16-inch. There are three processors available (although the 16" only offers the two higher-end systems): M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max.

| Chip   | CPU cores | GPU cores |
| ------ | --------- | --------- |
| M3     | 8         | 10        |
| M3 Pro | 11 to 16  | 14 to 18  |
| M3 Max | 14 to 16  | 30 to 40  |

 The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at 8GB RAM (up to 24 GB), while the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Max can go all the way up to 128GB of RAM.

 Storage options range from a 512GB SSD to a massive 8TB one, though the higher options are only available on M3 Max models.

 Apple also showed off a new color for MacBooks: Space Black. This option isn't nearly as colorful or exciting as the options for iMacs, but it is new. It's also only available for the M3 Pro and M3 Max models.
