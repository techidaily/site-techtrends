## Uninstall Apps Using the Trash Can

## Removing Apps With the Finder

 The drag-and-drop method of deleting apps with the trash can doesn't work for all apps, but when you combine it with the Finder, you can delete almost any application. Here's how:

1. Open a Finder window by selecting**File** \>**New Finder Window** in the Apple menu bar or by clicking the**Finder** icon on the Dock.

## Uninstall Apps Using an Uninstaller

 Certain apps may include an Uninstall tool inside their Application folder. In this case, you want to uninstall using that tool.

 These are often large apps like Creative Cloud products from Adobe or Valve's Steam client. To ensure that they completely uninstall from your computer, use the uninstaller if it's included with the application.

1. Open Finder window > click**Applications** to view all the apps on your Mac.
2. Click the application you want to uninstall. A folder opens to show its contents, including an Uninstall program if one exists.
3. Double-click the file entitled**Uninstall** inside the folder.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to uninstall the application. The directions vary depending on the program you're deleting.

## Uninstall Apps Using Launchpad

 Another option for uninstalling apps on a Mac is by using the Launchpad. This is an easy no-fuss way to uninstall the programs that you purchase from the App Store.

1. Click the**Launchpad** icon on Dock.

2. Locate the app you want to delete by entering its name in the search field at the top of the screen or by scrolling the pages of the Launchpad.

3. Click and hold the app until all the apps start to shake.
4. When the icon starts shaking, click the**X** that appears next to it.  
 If there is no X next to the app, you can't delete it through the launchpad. It may be required by the operating system or have an uninstall option you need to use.
5. Click**Delete** to confirm the app's removal.
