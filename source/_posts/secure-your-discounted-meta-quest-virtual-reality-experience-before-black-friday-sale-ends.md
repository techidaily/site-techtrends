## Secure Your Discounted Meta Quest ^ Virtual Reality Experience Before Black Friday Sale Ends

Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, released the Quest 2 standalone VR headset in 2020\. The price has changed several times since then, but now Meta is sticking to $250 for the 128GB model and $300 for the 256GB model. The prices for some accessories are also dropping.

 Meta confirmed in a blog post that the entry-level Quest 2 VR headset with 128GB storage will remain at $250\. That price was initially a deal for Black Friday in 2023, then remained at that price for the entire holiday season. The company said, "we’re permanently lowering prices on Quest 2 and its accessories, effective January 1! Our 128GB Quest 2 SKU will now cost $249.99 USD, while you can bring home the 256GB Quest 2 SKU for $299.99 USD."

 There aren't many options right now for standalone VR headsets, so the Quest 2 at $250 is still probably the best option for playing some [Beat Saber](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2448060205267927/) or [Asgard’s Wrath 2](https://www.meta.com/experiences/2603836099654226) on a budget. The upgraded [Quest 3](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/universal-chatgpt-open-doors-worldwide-communication/) still starts at $500, which is a significant leap in price. Google, Samsung, and Qualcomm are [working on a mixed reality headset](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952833/the-samsung-qualcomm-google-mixed-reality-headset-might-be-at-least-a-year-away) that might be a proper competitor, but it's unclear when that device (or devices?) will be available to purchase.

 Meta is also dropping the prices for some official Quest 2 accessories. The [Quest 2 Elite Strap](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-2-elite-strap/) is now $50, the [Quest 2 Carrying Case](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-2-carrying-case/) is now $45, the [Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-2-elite-strap-battery) is $90, the [Quest 2 Active Pack](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-2-active-pack) is $60, and the [Quest 2 Fit Pack](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/quest-2-fit-pack/) is $40.

 You may recall that Meta has changed the retail price for the Quest 2 several tmes. It was originally priced at $300 for the 128GB model, and $400 for 256GB, then the prices for both were [raised by $100 in 2022](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-using-obs-for-gamers/). Meta said the higher prices were required "to continue investing in moving the VR industry forward for the long term." The 256GB model [dropped to $430 in March 2023](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-adopt-the-best-practices-of-live-streaming-with-google-meet-youtube/), but the 128GB model remained at $400, until both models [returned to their original prices in June 2023](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-launch-strategies-for-fb-generosity-campaigns/).

 Long-term support remains an open question for the Quest 2\. It's now over three years old, and the Quest 3 is a significant upgrade in both features and graphical performance. Meta [ended mainstream support for the original Quest headset in March 2023](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhancing-your-contents-impact-smart-utilization-of-igtv-hashtags/), which was roughly four years after its introduction. The Quest 2 is more powerful and popular than the original model ever was, so it _should_ last longer, but Meta has not commited to any specific timelines.
