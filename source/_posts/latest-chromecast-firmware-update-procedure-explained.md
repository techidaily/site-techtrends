##  How to Update Your Chromecast Firmware Automatically 

 Google automatically pushes out new Chromecast firmware, so in most instances you should have the latest available version. However, such rollouts are often staggered, so the latest firmware version may take time to install. Here's what you can do to try and prompt an automatic update.

1. Go to Google’s Chromecast support page to check the latest firmware version available for your Chromecast device.
2. If you haven’t already,[ download the Google Home iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-home/id680819774) or the[ Google Home Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app) .
3. Ensure your Chromecast is powered on and ready to receive a Cast signal.
4. Make sure your smartphone and your Chromecast are both connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  
 To quickly check both your smartphone and Chromecast are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, open a cast-enabled app such as YouTube and tap the**Cast** icon. Your Chromecast device should appear. If it's not showing, you may need to reconnect your Chromecast to the network.
5. Open the smartphone app and locate your Chromecast device, then tap the device icon to get an overview of it.
6. Tap the**gear** icon to open device settings.
7. Scroll to the bottom of the page to reveal the Cast firmware version. This is the current firmware your device is running.

8. Compare your device’s firmware with the latest available version on Google’s Chromecast support page (step 1). If the firmware version on the Chromecast support page is newer (a greater number) than the build you have on your device, you can try to encourage an automatic update via the Google Home app.  
 If both versions are the same, you have the latest available firmware and don't need to do anything else.
9. To try and encourage an automatic update, make sure you’re still in the Device settings page (step 5).
10. Tap the**three horizontal dots** icon.
11. A pop-up window will launch with additional options. Tap**Reboot** to[ reset your Chromecast device](https://www.lifewire.com/reset-chromecast-4165369) .

12. Your Chromecast dongle will shut itself down and automatically restart. During this process, it will try to download and install the latest available firmware.
13. If the firmware is available, the installation process will show on your connected TV.  
 Unfortunately, there is no audible indicator for a Chromecast Audio dongle
14. Once the update is complete, you'll be able to use your Chromecast as normal.
15. To check your Chromecast is now running the latest firmware, repeat steps 3 through 5.  
 As noted, Google rolls out firmware updates in stages. If the update hasn't yet landed for your device, wait a few days and try the process again.
16. That's it! Your Chromecast should now be automatically updated.

##  How to Force a Chromecast Firmware Update 

 If new Chromecast firmware is available, but your device hasn't updated, you can try to force your Chromecast to download it. 

 This process is a little more complicated than an automatic update, and it’s not guaranteed to work. However, it’s certainly worth trying if you can see the firmware is available but it hasn’t yet pushed to your Chromecast.

##  Force a Chromecast Update on Windows 

Follow steps 1-7 above before proceeding.

1. To force a firmware update via Windows PC, turn it on and make sure it’s connected to the same network as your Chromecast.
2. Search for "**Windows Powershell** " and select**Windows PowerShell** to launch it.
3. Type in the following command, replacing \[IP ADDRESS\] with your Chromecast’s IP address:  
 Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -ContentType “application / json” -Body ‘{“params”: “ota foreground”}’ -Uri “http: // [IP ADDRESS]: 8008 / setup / reboot” -Verbose -UserAgent ” curl “
4. Press**Enter** .
5. Windows PowerShell will now instruct your Chromecast to try and retrieve and install the latest firmware.  
 This process can take some time, so be sure to leave Windows PowerShell running and your Chromecast connected.
6. Once complete, you can cross reference your Chromecast's firmware against the Chromecast support page. If the update was successful, both versions will be the same.  
 This process may take a couple of attempts to work. If your firmware hasn't updated the first time, feel free to try again. Alternatively, leave the dongle connected for a few days to see if it will automatically update.
7. That's it! Your Chromecast should now be running the latest firmware.
