You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more.

 What We Don't Like

* Need a premium subscription to view content ad-free.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .
