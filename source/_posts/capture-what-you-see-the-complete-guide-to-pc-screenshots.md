##  How to Take a Screenshot 

 The basic way to take a screenshot in Windows is the same way no matter what[ version of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/what-version-of-windows-do-i-have-2624927) you're using, and it's very simple: ​press the **PrtScn**  key on the keyboard.

* **PrtScn:** Press the button once to save a screenshot of the entire screen. If you have multiple monitors connected, a single press of the print screen button will save a screenshot of all the screens in one single image.
* **Alt** +**PrtScn:** Press these buttons at the same time to take a screenshot of a single window that you're focused on. Select the window once to make sure it's in focus, and then press these keys.
* **Win** +**PrtScn:** Using the Windows key with the print screen button (in Windows 8 and newer) will take a screenshot of the whole screen and then save it in the default Pictures folder in a subfolder called Screenshots (e.g.**C:\\Users\\\[user\]\\Pictures\\Screenshots** ).

##  How to Paste or Save a Screenshot 

 The easiest way to save a screenshot is to first paste it into the Microsoft Paint application. It's included with Windows by default.

 You do have other options, like to paste it into Microsoft Word, Photoshop, or any other program that supports images, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll use Paint. The quickest way to open Paint in all versions of Windows is through the Run dialog box.

1. Press **Win** +**R** .
2. Type**mspaint** into the**Run** field, and select**Enter** .  
![Opening Microsoft Paint](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fYsJ6UVx8AAQfRLYJZOpRg0WNKY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mspaint-566c41d2e9cc4a3f942e2bd6e41de3c6.jpg)
3. With Microsoft Paint open, and the screenshot still saved in the clipboard, use**Ctrl** +**V** to paste it into Paint, or select**Paste** .

![Screenshot of Paste button in Paint](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eY_JnmlU4nZDW3O3M9fb-WXW-rg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mspaintpaste-055a89525bb94cf8923a30a3e044df3f.jpg)
4. Press**Ctrl** +**S** , or select **File** \>**Save as** to save the screenshot.  
!["Save as" selection in Paint](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jsFWbGEcpxz02bT2lKrhU9QKdlg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mssaveas-3117783b3b4044e2a4e2861e24ac4b27.jpg)

 At this point, you may notice that the image you saved looks a bit off. If the image doesn't take up the_entire_  canvas in Paint, it will leave white space around it. To fix this, drag the bottom right corner of the canvas toward the top left of the screen until you reach the corners of your screenshot.

##  How to Take a Screenshot on PC With the Windows Snipping Tool 

 Another way to take screenshots is to use the[ Windows Snipping Tool](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-snipping-tool-4123251) .

* In Windows 10, type**snipping tool** in the search box on the taskbar and select the**Snipping Tool** from the list of results.
* In Windows 8, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, select**Search** , type**snipping tool** in the search box, and select**Snipping Tool** from the list of results.
* In Windows 7, select the**Start** button, type**snipping tool** in the search box, and select the**Snipping Tool** from the list of results.

##  Alternatively, Download a Print Screen Program 

 Although Windows works great for basic screenshotting abilities, you can install both free and paid third-party applications for more advanced features like fine-tuning the screenshot by pixel, annotating it before you save it, and easy saving to a predefined location.

 One example of a free print screen tool that's more advanced than the Windows one is[ PrtScr](http://www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/) . Another, [ WinSnap](https://www.ntwind.com/software/winsnap.html) , is good, but the free edition lacks some of the more advanced features of the premium version.
