_Titans_ manages to offer a fresh take on a classic franchise. All the stars of_Teen Titans_ , led by Robin (Brenton Thwaites), are a little older and a lot grittier. This superhero show isn't for kids.

 The episodic format makes_Titans_ much easier to digest than the four-hour director's cut of_Justice League_ . If you like this series, be sure to check out_Doom Patrol_ on Max, which takes place in the same universe and features many of the same actors.

 In the 1950s, an African American man named Atticus Freeman (Jonathan Majors) travels to the segregated American south to find his missing father. On top of discrimination from locals, Atticus must also deal with the ghosts of slave owners and monsters from H.P Lovecraft's twisted imagination.
