## Step-by-Step Tutorial: Empty Out Your Emails Using Gmail for Android/iOS

### What to Know

* Swipe up to load up to 251 emails in your inbox.
* Tap**Select all** \>**Delete** to mass delete emails in the Gmail app.
* Repeat until all your Gmail emails have been deleted.

 This article covers the steps for how to delete all emails at once in the official[Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-gmail-1172005) app on iPhone and Android. While it’s impossible to empty your entire Gmail inbox with a single tap in the app, you can delete batches of up to 251 emails at a time and repeat the process until you've deleted as many as you want.

 The steps on this page can be used for both the Android and iOS Gmail apps.

## How to Delete All Emails in Gmail App At Once

 Here are the steps for emptying your inbox in the Gmail app by deleting multiple emails in batches.  

1. Open the Gmail app and repeatedly swipe up to scroll down and load as many emails as possible.  
 The screen limit upon opening the Gmail app is 50 emails, but if you scroll down as far as you can, that limit should increase to 251 emails.
2. Tap**Select all** . Every visible email within your inbox will now be selected.

 An Undo option will appear in the lower-right of the screen for a brief few seconds. If you made a mistake, you can just tap it to undo the above deletion process.
5. Repeat the above steps until all your emails have been deleted from the Gmail app.

## How to Undelete Multiple Emails in the Gmail App

 When you delete an email from your Gmail inbox, it moves to the Gmail Trash folder. All emails within the Trash folder can be moved back to your Inbox at any time within 30 days of the deletion process being performed.

 All emails are permanently deleted from the Trash folder after 30 days.

 Here’s how to recover multiple emails in the Gmail app.  

1. From your Gmail inbox, tap the hamburger menu icon in the top-left corner.
2. Tap**Trash** .
3. Perform a long-press on an email that you want to undelete.  
![Three screens of the Gmail mobile app. In the left screen, the Hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) is highlighted. In the middle screen the trash can (labeled Bin) is highlighted. Nothing is highlighted in the right most screen.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oZbiyiYRBZegWB70q_rRFibbhy4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/C3-DeleteAllEmailsinGmailApp-annotated-3e007a972bd54787bb333765de9d93d9.jpg)  
 Gmail is customized based on your location. So, in my case, the Trash is called Bin. Depending on where you're located, it could say Trash or Bin.

4. Tap additional emails to select them.  
 If you want to restore all emails in the Trash folder, tap**Select all** .
5. Tap the ellipsis in the top-right corner.
6. Select**Move** .
7. Tap**Inbox** .
8. The multiple selected emails will now be moved back to your Gmail inbox.
