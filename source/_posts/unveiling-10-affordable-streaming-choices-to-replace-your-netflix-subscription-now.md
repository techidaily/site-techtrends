## [ Best for Smart TVs: Xumo](https://www.xumo.com/) 

![Watch Xumo on a smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jcdTC31yPmb0UXEaB-DRYc_G0A0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netflix-alternative-03-c735c9d89e1e44babf59630e8995d375.jpg) 

 What We Like

* Mobile apps cast to a smart TV.
* Hundreds of TV and on demand channels.
* Content changes frequently.

 What We Don't Like

* Can't watch shows in a web browser.
* Search finds more TV shows than movies.
* Not easy to pause movies and shows.

 Xumo offers a variety of TV channels that are similar to those found on broadcast TV. The Xumo app opens with a list of over 300 channels of live streaming content. You'll find food and travel shows, comedy channels, lifestyle stations, music shows, and more.

 The list of on-demand movies and TV shows is long. The best way to find a show is to browse the dozens of genres and collections, but the search function could be better, and doesn't return results for very many movies.

 Xumo powers more smart TVs than other programs like Netflix. If you have an LG, Vizio, Sharp, Philips, Magnavox, Panasonic, or Sanyo smart TV, Xumo is available for free. Xumo also works with Roku TV, iOS devices, and Android devices.
