## What Is Echo Dot Setup Mode?

 The first time it powers on, your Echo device will automatically enter setup mode. In setup mode, the Echo Dot connects to the Alexa app on your phone via Bluetooth. Once connected, you must connect your Dot to your Wi-Fi network. Your Echo Dot will not work without a Wi-Fi connection.

 You can tell your Echo is in setup mode when the ring of light turns from blue to orange. Once you've set up your Echo Dot, you can start using Alexa voice commands and[Alexa skills](https://www.lifewire.com/alexa-skills-4126799) .

## Why Won't My Echo Dot Go Into Setup Mode?

 If someone else previously owned your Echo, they likely already set it up. You'll still want to connect the device to your Alexa app, so you have complete control over its many functions.[Reset your Echo device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-alexa-on-echo-devices-4795683) to restore it to factory settings, then follow the instructions above to set it up. The steps for resetting your Echo Dot are different depending on your device's generation.  

 FAQ

* How long will the Echo Dot be in setup mode?  
 It might take some time for your Echo Dot to enter startup mode, but it will remain in this mode and glowing orange as long as it takes to pair with your smartphone successfully through the Alexa app. If the orange light disappears while you're still trying to connect the device, press and hold the action button to return it to setup mode.
* How do I get my Echo Dot out of setup mode?  
 Your device will automatically exit setup mode once you've added it to your Wi-Fi network from the Alexa app. If it seems stuck trying to get into setup mode and the spinning blue light never turns orange, restart your Echo Dot by unplugging it and plugging it back in.
