 What We Like

* Advanced features aren't free.
* Some privacy concerns.

[Our Review of Zoom](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476)

 Zoom is one of the fastest-growing Skype alternatives out there. That's because it's very flexible. It works just as well for audio calls as it does video chats, plus you can use it one-on-one or for group calls. Simple to use, it works via every platform possible, including your desktop. Just be a little wary about how easy it is to be[Zoom-bombed](https://www.lifewire.com/zoom-security-how-to-stay-safe-during-your-video-calls-4801664) and other security concerns.

## [Best for a Quick Call: Slack](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-slack-4685683)

![Slack app on MacOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w-UgVLMK-iTb9dvQ0NgUTFh517M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-free-skype-alternatives-of-2020-48423854-9c0c1443ff54458794d9a08ca42255a1.jpg)

 What We Like

* Screen annotation features.
* Works in a web browser.
* Ideal for business team collaborations.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited features for free users.

[Our Review of Slack](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-slack-4685683)

 Slack is often thought of as predominantly a business tool for collaborating via texts and instant messaging, but you can also make audio and video calls through the service. On the free plan, you can only video chat with one other person but if you just need to jump on a quick call, it's a great alternative as you probably already have Slack open and ready. It's also ideal for quick screen collaborations and annotations which are super useful in a business context. Just expect to need to subscribe if you want more powerful features.

 What We Like

* Huge user base.
* Text group chats of up to 256 people.
* Very easy to use.

 What We Don't Like

* Only 4 people in a video chat.
* Some privacy concerns due to being owned by Facebook.

[Our Review of WhatsApp](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-whatsapp-all-about-4781062)

 WhatsApp is one of the biggest instant messaging services in the world. It connects billions of users together, and it offers far more than just instant messaging. You can also use it to make voice and video calls, as well as group chat. Video chats are limited to only four people, which makes it a more intimate affair than most video chat apps, but it's hugely popular so if you're trying to arrange a chat with a relative who's not very tech savvy, they probably still know how to use WhatsApp.

 What We Like

* Built into all Apple products.
* Very simple to use.
* Entirely free.

 What We Don't Like

* Windows and Android users can only join calls in progress.
* App is only available for Apple devices.

[Our Review of FaceTime](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facetime-2000237)

 If you own an iPhone, iPad, or Mac then FaceTime is a very easy solution to use, provided the person you want to talk to also owns an Apple device. It's as easy as making any other call and still offers end-to-end encryption. You don't even need to install it as it's all built into Apple products, making it perfect for novices.

 In iOS 15 and macOS Monterey (12.0) and later, FaceTime gains extra features, including the ability to share your screen, listen to music, and watch movies in sync with the people you're talking to.

 What We Like

* Quick to access.
* Nearly everyone has an account.
* Extra features like being able to send money.

 What We Don't Like

* Facebook related security issues.
* Not much use for businesses.

[Our Review of Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719)

 Just want to chat with a friend, either via audio or video call? Facebook Messenger is a great way of doing this within seconds. Nearly everyone has an account so you won't have to worry about complex setups as it simply works through the user's browser. You can easily arrange an audio call with up to 50 accounts via the service. The only real downside is that there's no encryption involved which means Facebook Messenger isn't a good idea for businesses to use, due to privacy concerns.

## [Best for One-On-One Calls: Viber](https://www.lifewire.com/viber-video-messaging-1082227)

![Viber app on iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V--PGlrXC4Ik2RZfPGPxJa5JRZM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-free-skype-alternatives-of-2020-48423856-17453c6ddad847e49222f64bf7cb2d4d.jpg)

 What We Like

* End-to-end encryption.
* Very similar to Skype.
* Can delete messages.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited free features.

[Our Review of Viber](https://www.lifewire.com/viber-video-messaging-1082227)

 Viber works a lot like Skype with free text, voice, and video calls, and the option to pay to call phone numbers around the world. Crucially here, there's group audio calling which is quick to set up. There are some banner ads, but they're not intrusive. The added benefit of being able to delete text messages once seen is great for added privacy. Expect to pay if you want more than a one-on-one video call, though.

## [Best for Open Source fans: Jami](https://jami.net)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

 What We Like

* Completely peer-to-peer.
* End-to-end encryption.
* No adverts.

 What We Don't Like

* Not very well known.
* Relatively few users.
* Little basic looking.

 Keen to embrace a Skype alternative that isn't owned by a massive company? Jami is an[open-source](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-open-source-software-4147547) solution that works on a peer-to-peer basis. That means there's no risk of any company spying on your activities or keeping logs. It's ad-free and entirely free to use, while still offering key features like audio and video calls, screen sharing, and conference calls.

 The only issue here is the need to get other people on board, as Jami is far from a well-known brand. That can be to its benefit, though, as it should be more secure from hacks. And while it looks very basic and lacks the cool presentation that more established apps use, it does the job.
