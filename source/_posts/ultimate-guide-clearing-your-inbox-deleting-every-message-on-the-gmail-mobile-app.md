 The screen limit upon opening the Gmail app is 50 emails, but if you scroll down as far as you can, that limit should increase to 251 emails.

1. Click the**Select** box next to the**Refresh** icon at the top of the screen.

## How to Undelete Multiple Emails in the Gmail App

 When you delete an email from your Gmail inbox, it moves to the Gmail Trash folder. All emails within the Trash folder can be moved back to your Inbox at any time within 30 days of the deletion process being performed.

 All emails are permanently deleted from the Trash folder after 30 days.

 Here’s how to recover multiple emails in the Gmail app.  

1. From your Gmail inbox, tap the hamburger menu icon in the top-left corner.
2. Tap**Trash** .
3. Perform a long-press on an email that you want to undelete.  
![Three screens of the Gmail mobile app. In the left screen, the Hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) is highlighted. In the middle screen the trash can (labeled Bin) is highlighted. Nothing is highlighted in the right most screen.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oZbiyiYRBZegWB70q_rRFibbhy4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/C3-DeleteAllEmailsinGmailApp-annotated-3e007a972bd54787bb333765de9d93d9.jpg)  
 Gmail is customized based on your location. So, in my case, the Trash is called Bin. Depending on where you're located, it could say Trash or Bin.
4. Tap additional emails to select them.  
 If you want to restore all emails in the Trash folder, tap**Select all** .
5. Tap the ellipsis in the top-right corner.
6. Select**Move** .
7. Tap**Inbox** .
8. The multiple selected emails will now be moved back to your Gmail inbox.  
![Three screens of the Gmail mobile app. In the left screen the ellipses menu button is highlighted. In the middle screen, the Inbox is highlighted. In the right screen the confirmation message is highlighted.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ILi3uWvVcVR7upr3o_PiGb1BIqU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/C8-DeleteAllEmailsinGmailApp-annotated-2bc3c0e4f5804f2782c0532176f0f0bf.jpg)
