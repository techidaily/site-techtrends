##  Why Are My Amazon Prime Subtitles Not Working? 

 There are a few reasons why subtitles may not be working with your Amazon Prime Video account. These include:

* The app or browser cache may need to be cleared.
* Your device’s cache is causing issues and needs to be restarted/reset.
* The app needs to be updated.
* Closed Captioning (CC) needs to be turned on in the Accessibility Settings.
* Subtitle configuration error.
* The TV show or movie you’re watching doesn’t support subtitles for your chosen language.
* You’re using a legacy app that no longer receives updates from Amazon (such as an older model of Apple TV or Fire Stick).
* There is an issue with Closed Captioning for a particular TV show or movie.

##  How Can I Fix Prime Video Subtitles? 

 It's generally best to start with the easiest and most likely fixes first. Try each step individually and in order until you find the one that solves the problem.  

1. [ Check Subtitle settings](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-subtitles-amazon-prime-video-5198401) . Your Prime Video app’s settings menu is the first place you should go to try and fix a subtitle issue. Turning the subtitles off and then on may recalibrate the subtitle display and get it to display properly.  
 In addition to turning the subtitles on and off, try adjusting the size and font. Open the**Subtitles** menu during playback and click**Subtitle Settings** .  
 While you’re here, check to see whether you have Closed Captioning turned on. Amazon Prime Video may offer both with or without CC subtitle options for a given language, depending on the title. However, some users have reported issues where subtitles will only display during foreign-language audio. Try toggling the CC option on and off to see if it fixes the issue.
2. Check if subtitles are working with other TV shows or movies. Since the original content creator typically encodes subtitles, there’s a chance the Prime Video title you’re watching doesn’t support them. Try turning subtitles on for a few different TV shows or movies to ensure this isn't an isolated issue. If they still aren’t working, it’s likely an app-wide issue.  
 If a title doesn’t support subtitles, you’ll likely receive an error message like “Subtitles are not supported on this video.” However, this message may not always appear, so it’s still good to check if subtitles are working with other titles before trying different solutions.
3. Restart the Amazon Prime Video App. If subtitles aren’t working properly after making adjustments in the Subtitles menu, your next best option is to restart the Prime Video app. This step will clear up some of the app’s temporary cache, which could fix subtitle issues.  
 Depending on the device you’re using, exiting out of the app may not actually close it. If you can’t force the app to restart, you should restart the device instead.
4. Restart or shut down your device. Try restarting fully or power-cycling the device you’re watching Prime Video on. This list includes computers, smartphones, tablets, game consoles, streaming media players, and any other device that supports Prime Video. A system restart will clear the cache, which could be affecting playback performance in apps such as Prime Video.  
 Try[ power-cycling](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-vs-reset-4157868) or fully shutting down computers, mobile devices set-top boxes, and gaming consoles. If your gaming console supports app suspension make sure you manually quit out of the Prime Video app before initiating a reboot.
5. Check for updates. If you’re still having issues with subtitles after trying the fixes above, the problem is likely caused by a bug in the app itself. The best way to fix this issue is to ensure your Prime Video app is updated to the latest firmware version.  
 The easiest way to check for updates is to go to the app store where you initially downloaded the Prime Video app and navigate to the Prime Video app page. If an update is available, you should see an update option displayed.
6. Reinstall the app. Uninstalling the Prime Video app from your device will also delete all app files, so it’s a good way to potentially get rid of any files that could be causing subtitle issues. Depending on the device you’re using, this option will be labeled as**Uninstall** or**Delete App** under app settings.  
 Once you’ve deleted the app, reinstall it and check if subtitles are now working.
7. Watch Amazon Prime Video on a different device. To check if the cause is the device you’re streaming from, try using Prime Video on a different platform.  
 Since you can use your Prime Video subscription across multiple devices, you can install it on any device that supports the app to see if the problem persists.
8. [ Delete your watch history](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-your-amazon-prime-watch-history-4843243) . If subtitles still aren’t working across your different apps and devices, it’s likely an account-level issue. One fix you can try is to delete your viewing history, which will remove your user preferences for a particular show or movie.
