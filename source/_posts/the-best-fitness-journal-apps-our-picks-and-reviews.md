* Easy to log sessions.

 What We Don't Like

 Fitbod isn't technically free. New users get a free trial to use the app for a specified time and automatically roll over into a Fitbod Elite premium subscription once the free trial expires. Fitbod Elite offers the ability to generate and log unlimited workouts.
