* Adaptable to equipment, workout style, and time.
* Easy to log sessions.

 What We Don't Like

* Limited basic workout log functions.

 Fitbod will suggest a workout of the day, with suggested sets, rep counts, and weights based on A. S. Prilepin's famous powerlifting chart. Swapping exercises that target the same muscles is easy, and you can customize each workout freely. Fitbod comes with an extensive library of exercises that includes descriptions and videos with proper form.

 Fitbod isn't technically free. New users get a free trial to use the app for a specified time and automatically roll over into a Fitbod Elite premium subscription once the free trial expires. Fitbod Elite offers the ability to generate and log unlimited workouts.

 At the heart of Stacked are logging sets. You get a rest timer, the previous workout's data, personal records, a calculator for 1RM, proper keyboards for entering numbers, and a handy plate picker. Stacked also lets you pre-set playlists for workouts and control playback from the logging screen.

 ​In addition to training, you can track body measurements, define goals, and get graphs to visualize them.
