 Locking your Windows 10 PC is the best way to secure your computer when you step away. This won't quit or interrupt any running applications, and you have to type your PIN or password to get past the lock screen. Here are 10 ways you can lock your computer.

##  Lock Your Computer in the Start Menu

 Unsurprisingly, the Start Menu offers an option for locking your PC. Just click the Start button (the Windows icon), select your account name, and then click "Lock."

![Click the Start button, click your username, then click 'Lock.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/click-your-username-then-click-lock.png) 

##  Use the Windows Key

 Almost every Windows PC has a Windows key on the keyboard. As you've probably guessed, it's the one with the Windows icon. You can press Windows+L to lock your computer.

##  Ctrl+Alt+Delete

 The Ctrl+Alt+Delete keyboard shortcut is commonly used to kill unresponsive software, but you can also use it to lock your computer. Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and then click "Lock" in the menu that appears.

##  Lock Your Computer in Task Manager

 You can also lock your PC in [Task Manager](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-secret-sauce-for-massive-tiktok-content-grabs/). Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and then [click "Task Manager."](https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-top-15-gaming-capture-utilities/) You can also type "Task Manager" in the Windows Search box, and then select it in the search results. 

![Search 'Task Manager,' then click the result or click 'Open.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-task-manager.png)

 Go to the "Users" tab, select your user account, then click 'Disconnect.'

![Tap 'Users,' select your user, then click 'Disconnect.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/go-to-users-tab-select-user-click-disconnect.png) 

 A popup appears asking if you're sure you want to disconnect; click "Disconnect User" to confirm.

##  Lock It From the Command Prompt

 You can also type "CMD" in the Windows Search box to [open the Command Prompt](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-oppo-a78-frp-by-drfone-android/). Click "Command Prompt" in the search results.

![Search 'Command Prompt,' then click the top result.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-command-prompt.png) 

 Type the following command:

 Once this executes, your PC will be locked.

##  Use the Run Prompt

 This method is exactly the same as the Command Prompt method above, except you use Run. Just type "run" in the Windows Search box, and then click "Run" in the search results. You may also press Windows+R to open a Run window.

![The command to lock your PC in a Run window.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-run-command.png) 

 Once this executes, your PC will be locked.

##  Create a Desktop Icon to Lock Your Computer

 If you'd rather lock your PC with just a click, you can [create a desktop icon](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-skys-limit-for-your-visual-stories-unlimited-free-options-and-premium-choices/). To do so, right-click your desktop, hover over "New," and then select "Shortcut."

**![Create a new desktop shortcut](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Create-a-new-desktop-shortcut.png)**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Give your icon a name, and then click "Finish."

**![Name the shortcut icon](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Name-the-shortcut-icon.png)** 

Your icon will appear on your desktopâ€”double-click it any time to lock your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##  Set It Up in the Screen Saver Settings

 You can set your PC to lock after the [screen saver](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-guide-to-iphones-video-length-tailoring/) has been on for a certain amount of time. To do so, type "Screen Saver" in the Windows Search box. Click "Change Screen Saver" in the search results.

![Search 'Screen Saver,' then click 'Change Screen Saver.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-screen-saver.png) 

 In the "Screen Saver Settings" menu, select the checkbox next to the "On Resume, Display Logon Screen" option. Use the Arrow buttons in the "Wait:" box to select how many minutes should pass before your PC locks, and then click "Apply."

![Enable 'On Resume, Display Logon Screen,' set the time you want, then click 'Apply.'](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/on-resume.png) 

 We don't recommend this method for security reasons. It's always best to lock your PC before you step away from it.

##  Use Dynamic Lock

 Dynamic Lock is a feature that automatically locks your PC after you step away from it. It does this by detecting the strength of the Bluetooth signal. When the signal drops, Windows assumes you've left the immediate area of your PC and locks it for you.

 To [use Dynamic Lock](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/a-critical-look-at-huawei-p10-for-photography-enthusiasts-for-2024/), you'll first need to pair your smartphone with your PC. To do this, go to Settings > Bluetooth (on both Android or iOS) and toggle-On the slider. On your PC, go to Settings > Devices > Bluetooth and Other Devices, and then click "Add Bluetooth or Other Device." Select your phone, confirm the PIN, and they'll be paired.

 Now all that's left to do is enable the Dynamic Lock feature. Head to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options and scroll down to the "Dynamic Lock" section. Select the checkbox next to the "Allow Windows to Automatically Lock Your Device When You're Away" option.

**![Dynamic Lock Feature](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dynamic-Lock-Feature.png)** 

 Your PC will now lock if you move too far away.

##  Use the Remote Lock Feature

 The Remote Lock feature should only be used in a worst-case scenario. We always recommend locking your PC before you step away from it. However, we all forget things sometimes. If you've left your PC accessible, Microsoft has provided a way for [you to lock it remotely](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-the-art-of-livestream-recession-with-these-24-dynamic-tips/).

 However, this will only work if you've [enabled "Find My Device" on your PC](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-avoid-download-hassle-top-5-online-converters-for-gif-to-video/), you have a Microsoft account on the device with admin privileges, and the device is connected to the internet.

 To use the Remote Lock feature, sign in to your [Microsoft account](https://login.live.com/), and then click "Show Details" under the device you want to lock.

**![Show details for PC to lock remotely](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Show-details-for-PC-to-lock-remotely.png)** 

 Next, click the "Find My Device" tab, and then click "Lock."
