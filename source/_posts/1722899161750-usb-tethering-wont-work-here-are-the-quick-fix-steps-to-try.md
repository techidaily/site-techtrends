## How to Fix USB Tethering Not Working

 Follow these steps in the order we've listed them to try the easier fixes first:

 Before troubleshooting this issue, confirm that you're[using USB tethering correctly on your Windows PC](https://www.lifewire.com/enable-usb-tethering-windows-11-5196403) .

1. [Turn off Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/when-and-how-to-turn-off-wifi-818302) on your computer. A wireless connection can get in the way of USB tethering, and it takes just a few seconds to see if this is the fix.
2. [Make sure mobile data is working](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-mobile-data-not-working-4769125) . If your hotspot is using your phone's mobile connection, your phone needs to be working properly to serve data to your computer.  
 A quick way to rule this out is to disconnect the phone from the computer and make sure the internet works on the phone. If it doesn't, follow that link to see what could be wrong.
3. Reseat the USB cable. It's as easy as removing and reattaching the cable from your phone and computer. If you have another cable handy, now is a good time to swap it out.
4. Try a different[USB port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166) . This will tell you if the original port is faulty. Most desktop computers have USB ports on the front and the back, and laptops often have them on the side and back, so try both.
5. Unplug your phone from the computer and then restart both devices. This is an important but often overlooked step when troubleshooting tech problems. It's easy to do in Windows \[[Reboot a PC](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) \], iOS \[[Reboot iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restart-iphone-2000288) \], and Android \[[Reboot Android](https://www.lifewire.com/reboot-android-smartphone-or-tablet-4127180) \].
6. [Run a Windows troubleshooter](https://www.lifewire.com/run-diagnostics-on-windows-5214801) . There are several automated tools built-in to Windows that can address problems that you're not even aware of. When USB tethering is not working, it's best to run a troubleshooter that can address internet problems, like the one called**Network and Internet** in Windows 11.

7. [Update your drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . A Windows driver necessary for tethering can become corrupt. Updating and installing all necessary drivers can often fix this in about 10 minutes.

Several, if not dozens of bug fixes can be applied through an OS update, any of which could fix a known problem with USB tethering.
9. [Change the APN settings on your phone](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-apn-settings-on-your-mobile-device-2377931) . Android users can sometimes fix Windows tethering problems by changing their APN settings. Choose**default,dun** or**dun** .
