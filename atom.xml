There are many reasons why<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455" >downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you need a copy of this file, it’s best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515" >Restore ac1st16.dll from the Recycle Bin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The easiest possible cause of a “missing” ac1st16.dll file is that you’ve mistakenly deleted it.<br> If you suspect this, but you’ve already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893" >free file recovery program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480" >Start Windows in Safe Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete any of these steps if you’re unable to access Windows normally due to the error.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478" >Reinstall the program that uses the ac1st16.dll file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.<br> This file is most likely related to an older version of an <a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/" >Autodesk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> program, like<a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/viewers" >DWG TrueView <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview" >AutoCAD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (version 2006, and possibly others). However, your particular DLL file might be used with some other kind of software.<br> Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the ac1st16.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526" >Run a virus&#x2F;malware scan of your entire system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Some ac1st16.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It’s even possible that the ac1st16.dll error you’re seeing is related to a hostile program that’s masquerading as the file.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214" >Update the drivers for hardware devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that might be related to ac1st16.dll. If, for example, you’re receiving a “The file ac1st16.dll is missing” error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796" >drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >video card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> The ac1st16.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example.

That’s the context it’s being judged. It falls somewhere in between the <a class="link"   href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/silent-keyboard-lights-asus/" >JBL Charge 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unleash-hdr-potential-the-comprehensive-sdr-to-hdr-conversion-guide-for-2024/" >Sonos Roam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> based on price and size.</p><p> The ULT Field 1 has a removable rope handle which makes it easy to move around. It’s IP67 water and dust resistant so it can be used freely outside. It has control buttons along the top, one of which is a ULT button that activates a deeper level of bass. The speaker can be used in vertical or horizontal orientation with little to no difference in the sound profile. If you insist, you can also use it as a speaker phone. All told, it’s pretty versitle.</p><p> Although the Field 1 only has slightly less mass to it than the previous SRS-XE200 speaker, it feels a lot slimmer to hold. This new speaker feels like a big re-think from Sony, in all senses of design, aesthetic, and sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/sony-ult-field-1-in-the-middle-next-to-sonos-roam-and-sony-srs-xe200.JPG"                      alt="Sony ULT Field 1 in the middle, next to Sonos Roam and Sony SRS-XE200"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p>Left to right: Sonos Roam, Field 1, and SRS-XE200</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="There’s-an-ULT-Button-For-Extra-Bass"><a href="#There’s-an-ULT-Button-For-Extra-Bass" class="headerlink" title="There’s an ULT Button For Extra Bass"></a>There’s an ULT Button For Extra Bass</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/close-up-of-the-buttons-on-teh-sony-ult-field-1.JPG"                      alt="Close up of the buttons on teh Sony ULT Field 1"                > </p><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Speaking of the SRS-XE200, I found the Field 1 to have better clarity with an all-around better sound than the previous model. I thought the old speaker often sounded muddy and didn’t seem to have much mid-range clarity.</p><p> There are probably a lot of reasons for the sound difference, but one of the obvious things is the exposed drivers on either side of the unit.</p><p> Among the other things critical to the Field 1’s sound profile is the ULT button. It adds an extra boost to the low end like the bass button did on past Sony speakers. It works well and it gives the smaller speaker a beefy presence. With the ULT button turned off, the sound can teeter on being too hollow at higher volumes for bass-heavy genres. That’s to be expected since it is a $130 speaker, after all.</p><p> The ULT button is also on the new <a class="link"   href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-audiovisual-excellence-zooming-into-exceptional-podcast-recordings-for-2024/" >ULT Wear headphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and ULT Field 7 speaker. But unlike those devices, the Field 1 only has one level of ULT-ness, rather than two like the others. Again, it’s a smaller speaker and one is probably fine.</p><p> I left the ULT button turned on and hardly looked back. With the button activated, it sounds full. After the first few days, I found myself leaving it turned on no matter what music I was listening to. Even non-music baseball broadcasts sounded good in ULT mode.</p><p> While the actual ULT functionality was good, I hated the sound effects it made when turning on or off. The noise was too loud, lasted too long, and was startlingly unpleasant. It didn’t sound appropriate for any context. Seeing the ULT light come on or go off was enough of an indication for me.</p><p> I found that the speaker didn’t need to go higher than a 30% volume level for a bedroom or even a moderate-sized living room to produce a healthy thump. It could handle its own at the pool or hot tub in an outdoor setting too.</p><p> As a note, I wasn’t able to go through any customizations the Sony mobile app would offer because the speaker wasn’t compatible with it in its pre-release state. The app will be updated with the speaker’s public debut.</p><h2 id="The-Battery-Life-Is-Fine"><a href="#The-Battery-Life-Is-Fine" class="headerlink" title="The Battery Life Is Fine"></a>The Battery Life Is Fine</h2><p> I had no problem with the Field 1’s 12 hours of projected battery life. It seems like it might have been able to squeeze in a little more based on its size compared to the Sonos Roam’s 10 hours, but overall the Field 1’s duration is still competitive.</p><p> There’s a USB-C port on the back for recharging the unit. The rubber cover hiding the port was easy enough to pop off and wasn’t too stiff to maneuver around. All around the battery life and powering the product was fine—two thumbs up.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Sony-ULT-Field-1"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Sony-ULT-Field-1" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Sony ULT Field 1?"></a>Should You Buy the Sony ULT Field 1?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/human-hand-holding-sony-ult-field-1-showing-the-side.JPG"                      alt="human hand holding Sony ULT Field 1 showing the side"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS1nQCe95LU?si=A2dhdFkSAI61_nKA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Tyler Hayes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> As a portable Bluetooth speaker that you can keep in the car or bring around, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXL4FQBK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002642&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/sony-ult-field-1-review/&asc_campaign=Authority" >Sony ULT Field 1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a terrific choice.

The helpful site lets you track the sales and price drops of any product over the course of its existence on Amazon.

This is especially evident at the beginning of the chart, shortly after the CPU’s release, when it was constantly out of stock.</p><p> Camelcamelcamel does not and cannot factor the cost of shipping and handling into the prices shown. The website will, however, let you know if the product qualifies for <a class="link"   href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/" >Prime shipping <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> To help you shop, camelcamelcamel designates “Good Deal” and “Best Price” conditions for each listing based on its price history.

A 250-sheet paper tray yielding 36 pages per minute (ppm) should be ideal for a small business with just a few users or home office. While 250 pages may sound like a lot, it can go quickly with multiple users, so this isn’t a printer made for a larger office setting.</p><p> I was impressed with its printing speed, having burned through a 50-page report in no time, but the printer’s limitations were evident when I came across several pages with graphs. The black text print was as clear as it needed to be, though no clearer than my HP Envy 4520, but the graphs teetered on being a little too muddy for my tastes.</p><p> The printer can falter with fine details, so consider that when printing. If you have something like a graph or table, it may need to be scaled up to prevent becoming illegible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHafwnWSEQk?si=rejNVNpJZH2SqNLy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="A-No-Nonsense-Printer"><a href="#A-No-Nonsense-Printer" class="headerlink" title="A No-Nonsense Printer"></a>A No-Nonsense Printer</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/brother-wireless-hl-l2460dw-ink-and-drum.jpg"                      alt="Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW with ink cartridge and drum installed"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiW7sLvL65k?si=IHSeRFsYCrfqpn2o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Mark LoProto &#x2F; How-to Geek</p><p> What I really liked about Brother’s wireless printer was how easy it was to set up and get going. Outside of connecting to my network, the physical aspects of preparation were a breeze.</p><p> The printer comes with a drum and a 700-page-yield cartridge, and both were quick to install. The provided instructions are clear, ensuring you don’t wrestle with orientation or determining where each component goes. I didn’t have to replace the cartridge, having only printed about 300 pages, but the process is just as simple, as it slips right out of the drum, and the replacement clicks right in. When I do need a new one, it’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.brother-usa.com/products/tn830" >only going to run about $50 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a yield of 1,200 pages.</p><p> Paper is fed through the bottom auto-feed tray, which is compatible with nine paper sizes. I stuck with letter size with both the paper tray and manual feed, though swapping between sizes is a matter of following the premarked guides.</p><p> I ran into one consistent issue with the paper try, and it was surprisingly not the <a class="link"   href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/update-acer-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/" >duplex printing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Historically, I’ve had issues with jamming home office duplex printers, so I was delighted when it worked with the HL-L2460DW.</p><p> Whenever the paper tray got down to the last few sheets, it simply wouldn’t feed. Granted, I’m talking maybe the last five pages. Still, I expected the paper tray to be empty when the printer demanded more paper. The only fix I found was heavier paper, like cardstock.</p><p> My only other complaint regarding the feeders is maybe an unfair one. The rear feed doubles as access to paper jams. Unfortunately, it’s such a tight fit that I’m sure I’d struggle a little trying to clear the blockage. It’s a smaller printer, so I knew not to expect a ton of space to move around, and I do have meatier hands. I’ll say it’s not a drawback, but something to consider.</p><h2 id="Quick-Wireless-Connectivity"><a href="#Quick-Wireless-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Quick Wireless Connectivity"></a>Quick Wireless Connectivity</h2><p> Setting the printer up on my wireless network would have been a breeze if not for the horrifically small LCD. Just big enough for scrolling text, the screen was a questionable design choice. There was plenty of room for a larger screen, which would have made navigating the menu and inputting my network’s information more bearable. Maybe I’m spoiled by my HP Envy’s touchscreen, but the small, hard-to-read LCD seems unnecessary for any 21st-century printer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/brother-wireless-hl-l2460dw-lcd.jpg"                      alt="Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW LCD screen with text"                > </p><p>Mark LoProto &#x2F; How-to Geek</p><p> Beyond the screen, though, connecting the wireless printer to my Wi-Fi was seamless and quick. If you don’t want to deal with the potential lag over Wi-Fi, of which I experienced none, or don’t have a wireless network, Brother did include options for wired ethernet and USB connections.</p><h2 id="Purposefully-Feature-Light-to-a-Fault"><a href="#Purposefully-Feature-Light-to-a-Fault" class="headerlink" title="Purposefully Feature-Light to a Fault"></a>Purposefully Feature-Light to a Fault</h2><p> If you’re expecting bells and whistles just because the HL-L2460DW is a Brother printer, it’s best to taper expectations. That’s not the purpose of this relatively low-cost model, which caters to users who literally only need monochrome prints.</p><p> While many printers are sold as all-in-one units, with functions for faxing and scanning built in, I was fine with the lack of a fax application. All it would do is drive the price up. The lack of a scanner, though, seems to devalue the unit when you consider who the printer is for. I can think of fewer buyers who would benefit from a consumer-grade scanner than a small business that manages its own paper trail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/brother-wireless-hl-l2460dw-rear-feed.jpg"                      alt="Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW Rear Feed"                > </p><p>Mark LoProto &#x2F; How-to Geek</p><p> Of course, there’s a market out there for a scanner-free printer, but even as someone who barely uses the feature on his HP Envy, I wouldn’t opt for a printer that can’t scan documents.</p><h2 id="Brother’s-App-Is-a-Fine-Companion"><a href="#Brother’s-App-Is-a-Fine-Companion" class="headerlink" title="Brother’s App Is a Fine Companion"></a>Brother’s App Is a Fine Companion</h2><p> You can print from virtually anywhere using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002650/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brother.mfc.mobileconnect&hl=en_US&gl=US" >Brother Mobile Connect App on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brother-iprint-scan/id382775642" >Brother iPrint&amp;Scan app on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. However, based on the number of issues I had with the main feeder when it wasn’t fully stocked with paper, I wouldn’t rely too heavily on off-site printing. The app works well and will serve those who work primarily off their phone, but if you’re printing strictly from your computer, it’s a redundancy you’ll have no use for.</p><p> Everything you can do on the app—print, order toner, and check the status of your Brother wireless printer—can be done just as easily on your computer. You also don’t need the app for wireless printing. The HL-L2460DW is compatible with Apple AirPrint and the Android-enabled <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002650/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mopria.printplugin&hl=en_US&gl=US" >Mopria Print Service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Connecting to both was simple enough. While mobile wasn’t my primary means of using the printer, I can still see the value in this degree of connectivity.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Brother-Wireless-HL-L2460DW-Printer"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Brother-Wireless-HL-L2460DW-Printer" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW Printer?"></a>Should You Buy the Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW Printer?</h2><p> If you aren’t printing photos, don’t need color prints, and can work without a scanner, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2460DW-Monochrome-Subscription-Replenishment/dp/B0CPL2N5H6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002650&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/brother-wireless-hl-l2460dw-review/&asc_campaign=Authority" >Brother Wireless HL-L2460DW printer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a perfectly fine option. I don’t typically like to focus much on price, but the $160 price tag is reasonable for what you get. I think it should help as you shop around when you consider comparable printers, like the <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-charting-the-financial-pathway-of-tseries-within-youtube-market-space/" >MFC-L2820DW <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which can run almost $100 more for features you might not need. In fact, that costlier model even has a slightly slower printing yield.</p><p> The HL-L2460DW isn’t going to be winning any awards. It’s very basic and to the point, relying heavily on its speed and efficiency to turn heads. To its credit, the printer is fast, and I had no issues with paper jams.

Since then, millions of apps and developers have entered the scene, making the competition for the best apps more challenging than ever.</p><p>On Wednesday, Apple released its 2023 App Store Awards Winners, which were picked by the App Store’s editorial team based on the criteria of whether the apps provide users with meaningful experiences and inspire cultural change. </p><p><strong>Last year’s list: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reveals-the-best-apps-of-2022/" >Apple names the 16 best apps and games of 2022, with BeReal taking top honors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>“This year’s winners represent the limitless potential of developers to bring their visions to life, creating apps and games with remarkable ingenuity, exceptional quality, and purpose-driven missions,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. </p><p>The winning apps are all unique, tackling important topics such as meditating, reducing e-waste, helping non-verbal people communicate, connecting people with the outdoors, and more. </p><p>I had the opportunity to go hands-on with all of the winning apps at an Apple media event in NYC, and whether it was the apps’ graphics, storylines, mission, or uniqueness, each app brought something different to the table that left me impressed – and will likely impress you, too. </p><p>Since there are so many apps on the market tasked with accomplishing very different purposes, Apple broke down the winners into different categories, organized by the device the app is meant for and making a distinction between regular apps and games. There is also a bonus category for apps that drive positive societal change and leave a cultural impact. </p><p>For the full rundown of the winners and the chance of discovering your next favorite app, read on.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAnyQ0uj9Yg?si=Es4_ulcdM_-LuDcq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iPhone-App-of-the-Year"><a href="#iPhone-App-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="iPhone App of the Year:"></a><strong>iPhone App of the Year</strong>:</h2><h3 id="AllTrails-from-AllTrails-Inc"><a href="#AllTrails-from-AllTrails-Inc" class="headerlink" title="AllTrails from AllTrails, Inc."></a><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alltrails-hike-bike-run/id405075943" >AllTrails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from AllTrails, Inc.</h3><p>Sabrina Ortiz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>App Store rating: #36 in the Health and Fitness, 4.9-star rating, 842K ratings total</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-app-store-apps-of-2023-according-to-apple/" >Finalists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this category: <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128" >Duolingo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008" >Flighty <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ul><p>If you have ever wanted to start an outdoor activity but didn’t know what trail to go on or where to even start, this free app is for you. </p><p>The AllTrails app helps connect people of all different athletic backgrounds and interests with outdoor trails that they can use to participate in activities such as running, hiking, biking, or walking. </p><p>“We just want to get people outside, and we’re just trying to tear down the barriers to entry as much as we can, and oftentimes, it starts with information and competence, and we can do both with the app,” said Ron Schneidermann, CEO of AllTrails in an interview .</p><p>When searching for a trail, the app considers all your needs, including whether it has to be kid, stroller, dog, or wheelchair friendly. It also provides other specifics about trails, including user-generated trail reviews, different map views, trail previews, weather conditions, and GPS directions to help you pick the perfect trail. </p><p>Then, once you select a route, it helps you stay on course with your planned course. The app also has fitness tracking and community-building elements to encourage meeting your fitness goals. </p><h2 id="iPad-App-of-the-Year"><a href="#iPad-App-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="iPad App of the Year:"></a><strong>iPad App of the Year</strong>:</h2><h3 id="Pret-a-Makeup-from-Pret-a-Template"><a href="#Pret-a-Makeup-from-Pret-a-Template" class="headerlink" title="Prêt-à-Makeup from Prêt-à-Template"></a><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pr%C3%AAt-%C3%A0-makeup/id1434594204" >Prêt-à-Makeup <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Prêt-à-Template</h3><p>Sabrina Ortiz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><ul><li>App Store rating: #147 in the Graphics and Design category, 4.5-star rating, 26.4K ratings total</li><li>Finalists for this category: <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/concepts/id560586497" >Concepts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/davinci-resolve-for-ipad/id1581363826" >DaVinci Resolve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ul><p>Prêt-à-Makeup is a free app that provides users with digital face charts, like the ones that makeup artists use to plan their makeup looks.

The app showcases hand-picked, “visionary” films from international artists and creators that would typically be difficult to access for an average consumer. </p><p>The app is not just geared toward film fanatics (although a great fit for them, too) but also average consumers who enjoy watching a good quality film. The selection isn’t just limited to niche arthouse films and includes mainstream titles as long as they reach a certain caliber. </p><p>“Because we’re showcasing such a diversity of films, we have audiences who are interested in all sorts of things,” said Daniel Kasman, Vice President of Content at MUBI, to ZDNET. </p><p>Another standout feature from MUBI is that, unlike other popular streaming platforms, every movie on MUBI is handpicked by the team, ensuring that each movie presented to you on the app is a movie worth watching and elevating movies that the viewer may have otherwise missed. </p><p>“It’s just that these films often get lost in the shuffle of larger catalogs – the film from a different country, the film from a few years ago, a festival film, these are films that streaming services don’t pay attention to, but really are some of the best movies out there,” said Kasman. </p><p>The film selection is vast, ranging from rare indie films to classics. Although the app is free to download, a subscription fee starting at $12.99 a month is required to start streaming. If interested in trying the app, there is a seven-day free trial. </p><h2 id="Apple-Watch-App-of-the-Year"><a href="#Apple-Watch-App-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="Apple Watch App of the Year:"></a><strong>Apple Watch App of the Year:</strong></h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmXpl6irBYk?si=BXjGpQr6PXFcqhCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="SmartGym-from-Mateus-Abras"><a href="#SmartGym-from-Mateus-Abras" class="headerlink" title="SmartGym from Mateus Abras"></a><a class="link"   href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smartgym-gym-home-workouts/id922744883&data=05%7C01%7Csabrina.ortiz@zdnet.com%7C7491f6916cb04b225a8608dbf05747a0%7C4289d6102cfd46218c9644a1518ddb0a%7C0%7C0%7C638368029899529611%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=bLrFbo2GWv4HJT+WTuY+CAggvbj8Xdp6k4RGRgG/kK4=&reserved=0" >SmartGym <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Mateus Abras</h3><p>SmartGym&#x2F;App Store</p><ul><li>App Store rating: 4.6-star rating, 13K ratings total.</li><li>Finalists for this category: <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/planny-daily-planner/id1515324201" >Planny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tide-guide-charts-tables/id1406371071" >Tide Guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>As the name suggests, the SmartGym app is meant to act as a workout companion that doubles as a “smart” trainer, leveraging AI to create personalized workouts, make suggestions, and track your progress.

Furthermore, your session data counts towards your activity rings, further integrating the app into the Apple ecosystem. </p><p>The app is free to download, but the free version only gets you access to two routines and measures and 10 histories.

The digital playroom has Montessori-inspired educational toys and creative activities meant to help children learn and experiment through playing games. </p><p>“I would say that they [children using the app] are going to experience the diversity of the real playroom they probably have in their home just digitally in a really calm, sensory-friendly way, so they’ll be very empowered to follow their nose to explore and experiment,” said Pok Pok co-founder and CEO Melissa Cash to ZDNET. </p><p>The idea for the app originated when Pok Pok co-founder and Chief Creative Officer Esther Hubregh couldn’t find an app for her child that didn’t require constant monitoring, was educational without being overly academic, wasn’t overly gamified, addictive, or stimulating. Since Hubregh and her husband both had a background in animation, they decided to start a little project, evolving into what the app is today. </p><p>To ease parents’ other concerns, the app doesn’t have any paywalls or advertisements, so no accidents can happen, and children can just enjoy a seamless playing experience like they would playing with their toys in their own homes. </p><p>It is free to download; however, it requires a subscription after the seven-day trial ends.

The app is free, easy to use, and ultimately a great way to discover new establishments and treats near you. </p><p>Too Good to Go CEO Mette Lykke shared that there are other wins for consumers using this platform. </p><p>“So first is the aspect of doing good, feels good, when you know you save that food from going to waste, then there’s a great deal since typically they sell at a discount, and then last, it’s fun, because there’s this aspect of treasure hunt, you don’t know exactly what you’re going to get,” said Lykke to ZDNET. </p><h3 id="Unpacking-from-Humble-Bundle"><a href="#Unpacking-from-Humble-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Unpacking from Humble Bundle"></a><a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unpacking/id6450058135&data=05%7C01%7Csabrina.ortiz@zdnet.com%7C7491f6916cb04b225a8608dbf05747a0%7C4289d6102cfd46218c9644a1518ddb0a%7C0%7C0%7C638368029899576448%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OpbRs3yDiKi5K5e/BP/yx1FqrtoB6SoDU4Bkqg9O3kw=&reserved=0"><strong>Unpacking</strong></a> <strong>from Humble Bundle</strong></h3><p>Sabrina Ortiz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The Unpacking app lets users participate in a virtual home in which all they are tasked with doing is unpacking boxes and placing the possessions into their proper place in the new home. As you unpack, you learn more and more about the character whose life you are unpacking. </p><p>The repetitive task of repeatedly taking out things from boxes is meant to be meditative in nature. To further lean into that relaxed, zen state, the app has no timers, scores, or meters. </p><p>“I think the thing that catches you off guard is it allows you to relax into the experience. You’re just going to get quickly into this moment where you’re just putting your stuff away and thinking about your choices, but you’re also reflecting on the stuff you’re pulling out of the box, and that’s where you just really zone out – that’s kind of the zen moment,” said Oliver Teckert, VP of Production at Humble Games to ZDNET. </p><p>While playing the game, I enjoyed that there was no real task to accomplish. Instead, I could just leisurely take items out of the box, place them wherever I wished, and just keep going through the motions. </p><p>You have to pay a one-time $9.99 charge to download the app, and once downloaded, you are set to start unpacking. </p><h3 id="Finding-Hannah-from-Fein-Games-GmbH"><a href="#Finding-Hannah-from-Fein-Games-GmbH" class="headerlink" title="Finding Hannah from Fein Games GmbH"></a><a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://apps.apple.com/ro/app/finding-hannah/id1617252957&data=05%7C01%7Csabrina.ortiz@zdnet.com%7C7491f6916cb04b225a8608dbf05747a0%7C4289d6102cfd46218c9644a1518ddb0a%7C0%7C0%7C638368029899581583%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZR90tv08HYASb1awRSrjsJAH0p+x+hFIu/ETJjWDflU=&reserved=0"><strong>Finding Hannah</strong></a> <strong>from Fein Games GmbH</strong></h3><p>Sabrina Ortiz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Finding Hannah is an app with a gameplay storyline that features three generations of women, a grandmother, mother, and daughter, who are navigating life while Hannah, the daughter, is on a journey of self-discovery. </p><p>While moving through the storyline, the player will have to deal with family drama, find hidden objects, get to know the diverse cast of characters, unlock new scenes, and more.

On the free plan, you can only video chat with one other person but if you just need to jump on a quick call, it’s a great alternative as you probably already have Slack open and ready. It’s also ideal for quick screen collaborations and annotations which are super useful in a business context.

The only real downside is that there’s no encryption involved which means Facebook Messenger isn’t a good idea for businesses to use, due to privacy concerns.</p><p><strong>Download for:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/messenger/id454638411" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>06</p><p>of 07</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFHH14XlFCk?si=2HcjQbDx5eG0ZQAt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-One-On-One-Calls-Viber"><a href="#Best-for-One-On-One-Calls-Viber" class="headerlink" title="Best for One-On-One Calls: Viber"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/viber-video-messaging-1082227" >Best for One-On-One Calls: Viber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V--PGlrXC4Ik2RZfPGPxJa5JRZM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-free-skype-alternatives-of-2020-48423856-17453c6ddad847e49222f64bf7cb2d4d.jpg"                      alt="Viber app on iOS"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>End-to-end encryption.</li><li>Very similar to Skype.</li><li>Can delete messages.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Limited free features.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/viber-video-messaging-1082227" >Our Review of Viber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Viber works a lot like Skype with free text, voice, and video calls, and the option to pay to call phone numbers around the world. Crucially here, there’s group audio calling which is quick to set up. There are some banner ads, but they’re not intrusive. The added benefit of being able to delete text messages once seen is great for added privacy. Expect to pay if you want more than a one-on-one video call, though.</p><p><strong>Download for:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.viber.com/en/download/" >Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.viber.com/en/download/" >MacOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viber.voip" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id382617920" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>07</p><p>of 07</p><h2 id="Best-for-Open-Source-fans-Jami"><a href="#Best-for-Open-Source-fans-Jami" class="headerlink" title="Best for Open Source fans: Jami"></a><a class="link"   href="https://jami.net/" >Best for Open Source fans: Jami <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VIQ2ntGyjPvOUeDuh0CxbtVtK1E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/the-8-best-free-skype-alternatives-of-2020-48423858-4a6d4960f98b4ce1a3f047d6943f789b.jpg"                      alt="Jami app on MacOS"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5EKBEujWCw4?si=PwVvvervi8OrYaEA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Completely peer-to-peer.</li><li>End-to-end encryption.</li><li>No adverts.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Not very well known.</li><li>Relatively few users.</li><li>Little basic looking.</li></ul><p> Keen to embrace a Skype alternative that isn’t owned by a massive company?

That can be to its benefit, though, as it should be more secure from hacks.

As expected, Apple today announced a series of updates to VisionOS. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/live-updates-everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc-2024-including-ios-18-siri-ai-more/" >Everything Apple announced at WWDC 2024, including iOS 18, Siri, AI, and more <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Did they improve the overall quality of life and usability of Apple’s most quixotic moonshot? I’ll tell you this: Apple only addressed two of the ten items I asked for. On the other hand, Apple did announce a bunch of additional features. I’ll discuss them here in the order Apple presented them during the keynote.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-mXUpVQijU?si=f1MzflPJ8-bD2_iQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos"><a href="#1-Turn-2D-images-into-spatial-photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos"></a>1. Turn 2D images into spatial photos</h2><p>I’ve never been terribly impressed by Apple’s implementation of spatial photos, which are photos that have a 3D feel to them. The little square box and the fairly minimal lens separation of the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> resulted in something that seems more novelty than noteworthy. </p><p>Now, Apple has announced that it’s using machine learning to derive a left eye and right eye’s view of all your 2D photos, allowing you to view your flat photos as if they were 3D images. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-get-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-wont/" >Every iPhone model that will get Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones won’t) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Now, here’s the thing. I tried watching a couple of Marvel 3D movies via Disney+ on the Vision Pro. All the Marvel movies were filmed in 2D and digitally remastered into 3D movies. The 3D effect is pretty underwhelming. Sometimes an object seems to be pulled from the background, but otherwise, it’s not much to write home about. </p><p>I’m guessing that Apple’s 3Difying of a 2D image will be at about the same level. </p><h2 id="2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app"><a href="#2-Watch-those-images-together-using-SharePlay-in-the-Photos-app" class="headerlink" title="2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app"></a>2. Watch those images together using SharePlay in the Photos app</h2><p>And here’s another feature that I can’t imagine any users clamoring for. Now, if you have multiple Vision Pro users, they can all see and discuss the same image together while using the Photos app. </p><p>So, yeah, if Grandma Sadie in Seattle has a Vision Pro, Cousin Marty in Miami has a Vision Pro, and you have a Vision Pro in Yuma, you can all stand around the virtual photo screen and ooh and ah over pictures of baby Alice. </p><h2 id="3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center"><a href="#3-Gestures-for-opening-Home-View-and-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center"></a>3. Gestures for opening Home View and Control Center</h2><p>While it’s easy enough to open Vision Pro’s home view (the field of app icons) by pressing the Digital Crown on the top of the unit, getting to Control Center is a pain. VisionOS puts a tiny little arrow waaay up at the top of the viewing space, and you have to glance at it and tap your fingers together to get it to open. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, there are gestures. Holding your hand palm up and tapping fingers opens the app view. Flipping your hand over will give you time and battery level. A finger tap in this position will open up Control Center. </p><p>Unlike the previous two features, this <em>is</em> a quality of life improvement. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aa6vSdt1elM?si=qPhmO-hoWVIPBnnC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements"><a href="#4-Mac-virtual-display-improvements" class="headerlink" title="4. Mac virtual display improvements"></a>4. Mac virtual display improvements</h2><p>The Mac virtual display feature of the Vision Pro has been nice, but limited. In VisionOS 1, you could only show one 4K display. Personally, I’m waiting for Apple to ditch the entire display paradigm and just show windows, but that’s not going to happen this year. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>On the other hand, Apple “later this year” will enable you to create displays with more resolutions. The most interesting is the full wrap-around display, which will be the equivalent of two 4K monitors. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L603QXgjb3I?si=sMYHfMGy2kNPSHPt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Choo-choo-train-mode"><a href="#5-Choo-choo-train-mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Choo-choo train mode"></a>5. Choo-choo train mode</h2><p>To be fair, Apple didn’t call it that. We’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/itching-to-try-vision-pros-travel-mode-heres-what-to-expect-before-you-go/" >talked about the Vision Pro’s travel mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was mostly intended for airplane travel. </p><p>In VisionOS 2, Apple is announcing that there is dedicated support in travel mode for train travel. We know <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8ckKAjAWLw8" >people have already been successful using the Vision Pro on the train and even subway <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but in this case, Apple presumably tweaked performance somewhat. </p><h2 id="6-New-developer-APIs"><a href="#6-New-developer-APIs" class="headerlink" title="6. New developer APIs"></a>6. New developer APIs</h2><p>There are a ton of VR and AR APIs in Apple’s platforms. But this week, at WWDC, Apple is showcasing three new APIs developers can use to gain access to Apple technology. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-visionos-18-things-developers-need-to-know-about-coding-for-apple-vision-pro/" >Inside VisionOS: 18 things developers need to know about coding for Apple Vision Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Volumetric API:</strong> Allows complex 3D apps to run side-by-side. A volumetric API is at the core of most 3D content, because it allows developers to create, manage, and present volumetric content. My read on this announcement is not the introduction of a Volumetric API, but that it can allow multiple 3D apps to run concurrently.</li><li><strong>TabletopKit:</strong> Helps developers create apps that anchor to flat surfaces. One obvious example is board game kits, but this could apply to interior design apps, architectural and construction projects, gaming, navigation, and more.</li><li><strong>Enterprise APIs:</strong> These were described as enterprise-specific APIs, so we can assume they’re somewhat special purpose. Examples given were surgical training and manufacturing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRMCbJxLuwE?si=E5sfJvoqkv1qCMWz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video"><a href="#7-New-Canon-spatial-lens-for-creating-spatial-video" class="headerlink" title="7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video"></a>7. New Canon spatial lens for creating spatial video</h2><p>While iPhone 15 Pro users can create spatial video, there are limitations to using an iPhone as a camera. Apple announced today that Canon will be introducing a spatial lens for its <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Canon-RF-S18-150mm-Mirrorless-Processor-Detection/dp/B0B2KSD7WW/?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Cbfbe271d-4f99-40f4-b81e-3b3c556a641c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >EOS R7 digital camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Screenshot by David Gewirtz&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>This allows more commercial and prosumer projects where the photographer or videographer needs more control over the complex range of settings available in a more traditional camera. Those videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro, Apple’s only mention of Final Cut during WWDC. There’s also a new Vimeo app for VisionOS, that will allow spatial videos to be shared. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKjioJQaUh8?si=Ls_AeuvGsSyL5ny2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow"><a href="#8-Third-party-immersive-video-workflow" class="headerlink" title="8. Third-party immersive video workflow"></a>8. Third-party immersive video workflow</h2><p>One of the truly breathtaking experiences of the Vision Pro is what Apple calls Immersive video. This is a very big step beyond the typical 3D video we’ve seen in movies and TV shows. The entire experience wraps around you 180 degrees. When it’s done right, it’s astonishing. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-watched-apples-newest-immersive-video-on-the-vision-pro-and-it-was-my-aha-moment/" >I watched Apple’s newest Immersive Video on the Vision Pro, and it was my ‘aha’ moment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple is opening up the format for third-party creators to create immersive video. The approach is to use cameras and DaVinci Resolve Studio from <a class="link"   href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/" >Blackmagic Design <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There’s no doubt that Blackmagic makes excellent gear and that DaVinci Resolve is a fine application. It’s just a little surprising that Apple didn’t bake this capability into its own high-end video production tool, Final Cut Pro.</p><p>Even so, I think this is great. Those immersive videos are fantastic. </p><h2 id="Other-new-features"><a href="#Other-new-features" class="headerlink" title="Other new features"></a>Other new features</h2><p>Apple didn’t cover all the new features during its announcement. At the end of the Vision Pro segment, the company put up one of its feature grid graphics (shown at the beginning of this article). Here are a few that weren’t mentioned: </p><ul><li><strong>Mouse support:</strong> I mentioned this in my wishlist. Apple’s presenters didn’t mention it, but it’s on that grid of features. Hurray!</li><li><strong>Keyboard breakthrough:</strong> This was another feature I felt it was important for Apple to introduce, and apparently it will be available. No mention was made of it, so we have no idea if it’s limited solely to Apple’s own keyboards (but that’s probably the case).</li><li><strong>Bora Bora environment:</strong> I wanted to see more environments and we get…one. Personally, I think all the work on spatial photos and spatial videos could have been replaced with the ability for third parties to create 3D environments, but Apple didn’t go there. But hey, Bora Bora, right?</li><li><strong>Rearrangeable Home View:</strong> This was also not described but I’m guessing this means you can move around the Home icons.</li></ul><h2 id="What-do-you-think"><a href="#What-do-you-think" class="headerlink" title="What do you think?"></a>What do you think?</h2><p>I’ll admit, I’m fairly underwhelmed. I definitely would have thought there would be a bunch of new environments (at least one or two indoors), as well as third-party options. </p><p>Apple did announce that more than 2,000 apps were built specifically for the Vision Pro and more than 1.5 million iPad apps are compatible. But I’m still surprised that Apple didn’t create spatial versions of its remaining non-spatial apps (i.e., Books, Calendar, Clock, Home, Maps, Podcasts, Reminders, Shortcuts, Stocks, and Voice Memos). </p><p>And, I’m shocked that Find My support is still missing from VisionOS (or at least wasn’t mentioned). </p><p>What do you think? Is VisionOS 2 enough to get us through another year of this astoundingly expensive device? Is there anything in VisionOS 2 that wasn’t in VisionOS 1 that would inspire you now to go out and buy one? If you have a Vision Pro, will any of these features improve your quality of life? Let us know in the comments below. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

We all know what the Settings app does, and on the iPad, it’s instantly familiar to anyone who’s used an iPad in the past five years. But what you might not know about are the most important, noteworthy, and downright essential settings everyone should be using. Sometimes, these settings expand beyond the Settings app, too, which can make them hard to find.</p><p>Never fear, dear reader. I’ve uncovered 10 settings you should adjust on your iPad to take better advantage of its big screen, powerful performance, and versatile software.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nvb0775GOM?si=peBB_Mo_4zcZFuci" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Customize-your-lock-screen"><a href="#1-Customize-your-lock-screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Customize your lock screen"></a>1. Customize your lock screen</h2><p>Max Buondonno&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>In iPadOS 17, Apple added the ability to customize your iPad’s lock screen, and it’s one of the easiest ways to help the tablet reflect your personal style. You can alter the font, the wallpaper, and even add a few widgets to keep important information available at a glance. Personally, I have a nice serif font on my iPad with a weather widget and my to-do list, as well as an ocean background from Nomad (because I can’t go a day without looking at the water).</p><p><strong>How to:</strong> Wake up your iPad, unlock it, then press and hold on the lock screen. If you’ve used an iPhone in the past, you know exactly what to do next. Tap the “Customize” button and begin tweaking the lock screen to your liking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqeO4ed766s?si=AWtKHxP4hvQRd_lk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Configure-your-focus-settings"><a href="#2-Configure-your-focus-settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Configure your focus settings"></a>2. Configure your focus settings</h2><p>I kid you not: The Focus settings that Apple rolled out a few years ago might be some of my most-used settings of all time. For those unfamiliar, Focus modes are basically fancy Do Not Disturb profiles that can be enabled manually, automatically at a certain time of day, or even when you travel somewhere. They allow you to control which notifications you see, who can contact you, and more. It’s helpful when you want certain notifications while at work and others while you’re relaxing at home. </p><p>I have modes set up for sleeping, work, personal time, and general use. They’re the perfect tool to lean on if you want more control over your notifications than just flicking on Do Not Disturb.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; Focus on your iPad, and you’ll find various options to set up a Focus mode for work, personal, fitness, mindfulness, and more. The interface will guide you through setting up your notification settings, which contacts can ping you, and more. Plus, once you’ve set it up, it’ll sync automatically with your iPhone, Apple Watch, and Mac.</p><h2 id="3-Turn-on-Stage-Manager-when-you-need-more-multitasking-chops"><a href="#3-Turn-on-Stage-Manager-when-you-need-more-multitasking-chops" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn on Stage Manager when you need more multitasking chops"></a>3. Turn on Stage Manager when you need more multitasking chops</h2><p>Max Buondonno&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>If you use your iPad for work, one of the best features to take advantage of is Stage Manager. Introduced with iPadOS 16, the feature lets you organize all the apps you have open on the left, giving you easy access to call them over whenever you need them. Once you tap the one you want, it floats to the right and opens in a larger window. </p><p>You can customize the size of the window, bring up secondary apps in the same view, and even have a separate list of apps open on an external monitor (assuming you have a recent iPad Pro). It’s a handy feature for when you want your iPad to feel more like a desktop computer.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/"><strong>The best iPad models: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Swipe down on the top-right corner to access Control Center, then tap the Stage Manager button to activate it (it looks like a rectangle with three smaller rectangles next to it). Alternatively, you can go to Settings &gt; Multitasking &amp; Gestures and turn on Stage Manager from there. When you’re done using it, you can choose either option to turn it off.</p><h2 id="4-Save-your-eyes-at-night-with-Night-Shift"><a href="#4-Save-your-eyes-at-night-with-Night-Shift" class="headerlink" title="4. Save your eyes at night with Night Shift"></a>4. Save your eyes at night with Night Shift</h2><p>Yes, I realize this setting doesn’t <em>actually</em> protect your eyesight in the long run, nor is it a life-changing hack that everyone should use. But Night Shift on the iPad does make staring at your screen a bit easier when it’s dark out, especially if you have to spend a lot of time staring at a text field (like me). I’ve felt less eye strain while using the setting at night; it helps to relax my mind a bit since all the colors are much warmer. It’s worth giving a shot if you like to use your iPad at night.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-ipad-pros-tandem-oled-tells-us-about-future-device-screens/"><strong>What iPad Pro’s Tandem OLED tells us about future device screens</strong></a></p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Head to Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Night Shift. From there, you can manually turn it on, schedule it to turn on during certain times, and adjust how warm you want your display to turn.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUqw4TLvWs?si=srv1OeLOe579gLwj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Low-Power-Mode-can-quickly-become-your-best-friend"><a href="#5-Low-Power-Mode-can-quickly-become-your-best-friend" class="headerlink" title="5. Low Power Mode can quickly become your best friend"></a>5. Low Power Mode can quickly become your best friend</h2><p>There’s no doubt that iPads (especially some of the more recent models) have great battery life. My iPad cruises easily through a full day of use before conking out at bedtime. But that’s only true if you limit the amount of heavy lifting you put your iPad through. If you’re editing photos or videos, playing lots of games, or using it on a spotty Wi-Fi network for very long, it’s going to die sooner than you expect.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-ipad-mini-is-still-the-best-ipad-for-me-in-2024-and-not-the-air-or-pro/" >Why the iPad Mini is still the best iPad for me (and not the Air or Pro) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That’s where Low Power Mode comes in. With Low Power Mode, your iPad will limit your screen brightness and refresh rate, disable features like background app refresh and iCloud photo syncing, limit visual effects, and more. These sacrifices will be well worth it, though, when you realize they can add another hour or two of endurance to your iPad – all with the tap of a button.</p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Swipe down from the top right corner to access Control Center, then tap the battery button to enable it. Your battery meter will then turn yellow, indicating that Low Power Mode is on. To disable it, follow the same steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58KlTPHv8dU?si=7ICagyNgrao7OkVO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Hide-your-notifications-from-prying-eyes"><a href="#6-Hide-your-notifications-from-prying-eyes" class="headerlink" title="6. Hide your notifications from prying eyes"></a>6. Hide your notifications from prying eyes</h2><p>Sometimes, you just want to keep the contents of your iPad’s notifications to yourself, whether for work reasons or if you’re planning a surprise party for someone and they see the email confirming the delivery of their birthday cake. On the iPad, it’s easy to lock away your notifications and only make them visible once you’ve used your fingerprint or face to log in.</p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Show Previews and change it from “Always” to “When Unlocked.”</p><h2 id="7-Split-or-float-your-keyboard"><a href="#7-Split-or-float-your-keyboard" class="headerlink" title="7. Split or float your keyboard"></a>7. Split or float your keyboard</h2><p>Max Buondonno&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Unless you have an external keyboard, trying to type on the iPad is generally a hassle. It isn’t like you can hold it up and type on it like you can your phone – it’s simply too big. Luckily, Apple includes a way to make typing easier on the iPad by splitting the keyboard in half. This floats one portion of the keyboard to the left and the other to the right, making it way easier to type without a physical keyboard.</p><p>If that’s your bag, you can also shrink your keyboard and have it float on top of whatever you’re doing. This makes the keyboard about the same size as an iPhone keyboard, and you can drag it to either side of the screen so you can type with just your thumb, or swipe to type like I do.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-pro-keyboard-case/"><strong>The best iPad Pro keyboard cases you can buy: Expert tested</strong></a></p><p><strong>How to split</strong>: Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard and tap on “Split Keyboard.” Then, when you open an app where the keyboard presents itself, touch and hold on the keyboard button in the bottom right corner and slide your finger to the split option. Your keyboard will then divide in half on either side of the screen. You can follow the same steps in reverse to turn it off.</p><p><strong>How to float</strong>: Open an app where the keyboard will pop up. Then, take two fingers and pinch the keyboard. This will cause it to shrink to iPhone-size. You can then drag it around the screen by touching and holding the gray bar on the bottom. When you want it to return to its normal size, just pinch outward on the keyboard.</p><h2 id="8-Make-sure-your-screen-is-refreshing-as-fast-as-possible"><a href="#8-Make-sure-your-screen-is-refreshing-as-fast-as-possible" class="headerlink" title="8. Make sure your screen is refreshing as fast as possible"></a>8. Make sure your screen is refreshing as fast as possible</h2><p>Every iPad Pro since 2018 has supported what Apple calls ProMotion, which increases your display’s refresh rate and makes everything – scrolling, animations, multitasking, and more – look smoother. It’s one of those features that you don’t realize you want until you have it, and then you can never go back. </p><p>Of course, while the feature is enabled out of the box, there’s always a chance you aren’t taking advantage of it on your iPad Pro, and I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence if I didn’t ask you to check the setting.</p><p><strong>How to</strong>: Head over to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Motion and ensure that “Limit Refresh Rate” <em>isn’t</em> enabled. If it is, your iPad’s screen will remain locked to 60Hz, and who even uses 60Hz screens anymore?</p><h2 id="9-Tweak-the-Control-Center"><a href="#9-Tweak-the-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="9. Tweak the Control Center"></a>9. Tweak the Control Center</h2><p>Max Buondonno&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>I’ve always felt like the Control Center is slightly underrated for all the stuff it can do. Not only does it give you quick access to your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth settings, but you can customize it to your heart’s delight with all sorts of life-simplifying shortcuts, from easy access to Shazam to starting a screen recording with the touch of a button. It can become a life-changing feature if you use it the right way.</p><p><strong>How to:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Control Center on your iPad, and you’ll find all the controls you can add and remove. To add a new one, tap the green plus icon and it’ll move to the “Included Controls” section. From there, you can rearrange which controls are presented first by dragging the three-line button to the right and sliding up or down the list. If you want to remove a control, tap the red minus button and it’ll go back to “More Controls.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAzTErKy6h8?si=vi5z3M9_7fW6qiAJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Attention-Awareness-will-keep-the-screen-awake-while-you-use-it"><a href="#10-Attention-Awareness-will-keep-the-screen-awake-while-you-use-it" class="headerlink" title="10. Attention Awareness will keep the screen awake while you use it"></a>10. Attention Awareness will keep the screen awake while you use it</h2><p>Let’s say you’re reading an e-book or a feature piece .com (as one does), and you’re taking your time reading each paragraph presented on your iPad’s screen. After a while, your display can start to dim down and attempt to enter sleep mode. You can always lengthen the amount of time it takes to go to sleep, but for those who have an iPad Pro with Face ID, there’s an even better way to manage this: Attention Awareness.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-reading-tablet/" >The best reading tablets: Expert tested and recommended <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Using the TrueDepth cameras, Attention Awareness can keep tabs on when you’re looking at your iPad’s screen and keep it awake until you look away.

Known as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the technology promises to simplify daily tasks, integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT, help fine-tune your writing, and improve Siri. Unfortunately, Apple users won’t get to enjoy these features when the new OS versions arrive in September.</p><p>According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-28/apple-intelligence-to-miss-initial-release-of-upcoming-ios-18-ipados-overhauls" >Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the company plans to start rolling out Apple Intelligence to users in a software update scheduled for October. Citing “people with knowledge of the matter,” Gurman said that the new AI features will likely arrive with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, a few weeks after the debut of the latest OS versions.</p><p>Even now, Apple is preparing developer betas of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 for launch as soon as this week, according to Gurman. This move is unusual, as the company doesn’t typically release previews of software updates until the initial version has already reached the public.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-ios-18-will-impact-your-iphones-battery-health-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/"><strong>How iOS 18 will impact your iPhone’s battery health</strong></a></p><p>A lot is riding on Apple’s entry into the AI landscape, meaning the company needs to test and get feedback from developers as early as possible, especially amid concerns over the reliability of the new features. With major players like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI firmly entrenched in the world of generative AI, Apple is in the awkward position of playing catchup. The company is counting on Apple Intelligence to prove that it can compete, and Apple users who are tired of Siri’s embarrassing flaws are waiting to see if AI will deliver <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >much-needed improvements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the voice assistant.</p><p>Apple has been busy with the usual beta versions of its upcoming operating systems. For the iPhone, the company released the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-download-ios-18-public-beta-on-iphone-right-now-heres-how-and-which-models-support-it/" >public beta of iOS 18 on July 17 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Following the first developer beta launched in June, the fourth iteration for developers rolled out last week.</p><p>These beta versions don’t include the much-anticipated AI features – another reason Apple wants to release the developer beta of iOS 18.1 as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/"><strong>Every iPhone model that can be updated to Apple’s iOS 18 (and which ones can’t)</strong></a></p><p>The delay in the rollout of Apple Intelligence also means that the iPhone 16 won’t include the AI features when it launches, likely in mid to late September. That’s also unusual as most new iPhones incorporate the latest features.</p><p>Even when iOS 18.1 lands in October, certain key AI upgrades will be missing. In a June 16 release of his Power On newsletter, Gurman said that some AI features related to Siri will arrive in 2024, but <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >others won’t pop up until the first half of 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>As for Siri, the updates you can expect this year include a new interface, the ability to understand you if you make a mistake, more natural conversation, and a “Type to Siri” option that lets you type a request instead of speaking it. </p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Still to come for Apple Intelligence will be the ability to find and act on items on your device based on their context, an awareness of your current screen, and the ability to control your device and apps via several actions in one request.</p><p>As an Apple user, I’m more than willing to wait for the AI skills and Siri improvements if it means they’ll work properly and be relatively bug-free. Given the delays, though, the onus is on Apple to get it right.</p><h4 id="Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence"></a>Artificial Intelligence</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-chatgpt-scanned-170k-lines-of-code-in-seconds-and-saved-me-hours-of-work/"  title="How I used ChatGPT to scan 170k lines of code in seconds and save me hours of detective work">How I used ChatGPT to scan 170k lines of code in seconds and save me hours of detective work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ways-to-write-better-chatgpt-prompts-and-get-the-results-you-want-faster/"  title="6 ways to write better ChatGPT prompts -

Soft resetting is different from simply turning the TV off. To reset your Samsung TV, press and hold the<strong>power</strong> button on the remote until the Samsung logo flashes on the screen. If you perform the procedure successfully, the LED on the front of the TV will turn red and blink, and then the TV will turn back on. You can then go ahead and check to see if your apps work.<br> You can also turn the TV off, unplug it from the power, and wait one minute (at least) before plugging it back in. Then, you can turn the TV back on and check to see if the apps work.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570" >Restart your network hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you have access to your network hardware, restarting your modem and router may fix any connectivity issues. Unplug the modem and router from power, wait at least 30 seconds, then plug the modem back in. Wait for the modem to connect, then plug the router back in. When your Wi-Fi network becomes available, check if your Samsung TV apps work.</li><li><strong>Reset the network settings on your TV</strong> . If resetting your network hardware didn’t work, try resetting the network settings on your TV to establish a fresh connection. Open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>General</strong> &gt;<strong>Network</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Network</strong> . You will then need to reconnect your Samsung TV to your wireless network.<br> You’ll need your Wi-Fi password to perform this step, so make sure you have it available before you attempt this fix.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/is-website-down-3482172" >Verify that there aren’t any outages <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . When an app service provider has network connectivity issues, the corresponding Samsung TV app won’t work. On your computer or phone, try going to the app’s website to see if you can stream a show or movie. For example, if your Hulu app isn’t working, go to<a class="link"   href="https://hulu.com/" >Hulu.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a web browser on your computer and try to watch a video. You can also check social media accounts associated with the app or contact customer service to see any outages.</li><li><strong>Clear the app cache</strong> . Try clearing the cache of any app that doesn’t work. Press<strong>home</strong> on your remote &gt;<strong>Support</strong> &gt;<strong>Device Care</strong> . Select<strong>Manage Storage</strong> , and select one or more apps. Then press<strong>down</strong> &gt;<strong>View Details</strong> &gt;<strong>Clear Data</strong> &gt;<strong>Clear Cache</strong> .<br> Note: This option is only available on newer Samsung TVs. If you don’t see the option, then<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-apps-on-a-samsung-smart-tv-4589138" >delete any Samsung TV app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that doesn’t work, and then<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/download-apps-on-samsung-smart-tv-5223578" >reinstall it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><strong>Turn off your VPN</strong> . Some apps are region-locked, in which case they won’t work if your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778" >VPN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is connected to the wrong region. If the app has blocked the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ip-address-2625920" >IP addresses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> associated with the VPN, that will also prevent the app from working. Try disabling or uninstalling any VPN app you have installed on your Samsung TV or disabling any VPN running directly on your router.</li><li><strong>Run device care</strong> . If your Samsung TV has Device Care, try running it. Device Care is an automated troubleshooting tool built into some Samsung TVs, which may help identify or fix your problem. Press<strong>home</strong> on your remote &gt;<strong>Support</strong> &gt;<strong>Device Care</strong> &gt;<strong>Start Device Care</strong> .</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/update-samsung-smart-tv-4172014" >Check for system updates on your TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If your Samsung TV firmware is outdated, that can prevent apps from working. Open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Support</strong> &gt;<strong>Software Update</strong> &gt;<strong>Update Now</strong> , and install any available updates.</li><li><strong>Reset your Smart Hub</strong> . If your Samsung TV uses the Smart Hub menu system, resetting it may allow your apps to work again. Open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Support</strong> &gt;<strong>Service Care</strong> &gt;<strong>Self Diagnosis</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Smart Hub</strong> .<br> For older models, open<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Support</strong> &gt;<strong>Self Diagnosis</strong> &gt;<strong>Reset Smart Hub</strong> .</li></ol><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-experts-insight-downloading-audio-on-apple-gadgets/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Expert's Insight Downloading Audio on Apple Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-tricks-for-snagging-youtube-dialogues/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Tricks for Snagging YouTube Dialogues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-sites-to-explore-glossy-golden-typography-designs/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Sites to Explore Glossy, Golden Typography Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/erste-wahl-fur-fans-kostenlose-downloadseiten-der-top-produktionen-von-hollywood-bis-bollywood/"><u>Erste Wahl Für Fans - Kostenlose Downloadseiten Der Top-Produktionen Von Hollywood Bis Bollywood</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/iphone-wont-connect-to-itunes-for-backup-here-are-the-solutions/"><u>IPhone Won't Connect to iTunes for Backup?

I’ve tested this previously on <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >ESR’s in-car iPhone charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it works really well.

There’s a fan built into the wireless charging head to keep it cool in use. Again, this is <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >the same charging head that I tested in my truck in the hot sun <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it did an amazing job of keeping my iPhone cool while charging. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/is-this-the-ultimate-wireless-car-charger-my-iphone-tells-me-yes/" >Is this the ultimate wireless car charger? My iPhone tells me yes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I appreciate that this kit comes with a charger. Quite a few of the others I’ve tried require you to buy your own, which isn’t a huge problem. But having everything you need in the box is a nice touch and prevents confusion on the owner’s part. </p><p>Charger included.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Before you can charge your Apple Watch you will need to find your Apple Watch charger, as you’ll need to attach this to the charging station. </p><p>Now, previous ones I’ve tested have needed a USB-A version of the Apple Watch charger. I spent a good half hour looking for one before realizing that this charging station can accommodate both USB-A and USB-C flavors of the Apple Watch charging cable. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-keeps-selling-out-of-this-3-in-1-charging-cube-i-tested-one-to-see-if-its-worth-the-wait/"><strong>Apple keeps selling out of this 3-in-1 charging cube. I tested one to see if it’s worth the wait</strong></a> </p><p>To fit the Apple Watch charging cable, you need to unclip the base and thread the charging cable into the slot cut in the base. And I have to say, I’m impressed by the precision of this slot. </p><p>I mean, take a look at it. </p><p>The precision of the slot of the Apple Watch charging cable is impressive.</p><p>Adrian Kingsley-Hughes&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Another feature that I appreciate is the sleep mode feature. Too many nightstand charging stations are a Christmas tree of eye-piercing LED lights. A single button on this charging station turns off the LEDs and the fan, ensuring that you have a good night’s sleep. </p><p>As I said earlier, I’ve been using this charging station for several weeks now, and I’ve had no problem at all. The charger unit is sturdy and made very well, the magnets do a fine job of holding the iPhone and AirPods Pro in place, and the unit charges everything just as you’d expect. Oh, and night mode means you don’t have to try to sleep next to a pile of glowing LEDs. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-accessory/"><strong>The best

Both of these smartphones are equipped with features that can make you enhance your daily activities while empowering your professional endeavors. With the cameras being the focal point of both units’ external designs, you can expect some of the best in mobile photography to come from the two. </p><p>While the Pixel 6 Pro at time of release was only $100 cheaper ($899) than the $999.99 iPhone 13 Pro, you’re still spending big bucks on either device. To help you make the right buying decision, here are the key reasons why you would want to go with one Pro phone over the other. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBN1gYY5hUs?si=p89CMiMzeJzU0wGu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Google Pixel 6 Pro</strong></th><th><strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>6.5x3x0.4 inches</td><td>5.78x2.81x0.3 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>6.7-inch OLED, 120Hz; 31,200 X 1,440 pixels, 512 PPI</td><td>6.1-inch OLED, 120Hz, 2,532 X 1,170 pixels, 457 PPI</td></tr><tr><td>Cameras</td><td>50MP Wide, 48MP Telephoto, 12MP Ultra-wide</td><td>12MP main, 12MP Telephoto, 12MP Ultra-wide</td></tr><tr><td>Procesor</td><td>Google Tensor</td><td>Apple A15 Bionic</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>12GB</td><td>6GB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Non-expandable, 128GB, 256GB</td><td>Non-expandable, 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>5,003 mAh</td><td>3.095 mAh</td></tr><tr><td>Unlock Security</td><td>Under-display fingerprint sensor</td><td>Face ID recognition</td></tr><tr><td>Durability</td><td>IP68</td><td>IP68</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Android 12</td><td>iOS 15.4</td></tr><tr><td>Colors</td><td>Cloudy White, Sorta Sunny, Stormy Black</td><td>Alpine Green, Silver, Gold, Graphite, Sierra Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F6%5Fpro?hl=en-US&pli=1" >Starting at $899 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td><td><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/key-features/?afid=p238%257CsNQZDFTnQ-dc_mtid_20925d2q39172_pcrid_588006468460_pgrid_126654828229_&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-iphone--slid---Brand-iphone13pro-avail-&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Starting at $999 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUqw4TLvWs?si=srv1OeLOe579gLwj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><hr><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-Google-Pixel-6-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-Google-Pixel-6-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro if…</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KKovVi9epE?si=EF7KA7b4KsEpWA-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-fun-and-experimental-camera-features"><a href="#1-You-want-fun-and-experimental-camera-features" class="headerlink" title="1. You want fun and experimental camera features"></a>1. You want fun and experimental camera features</h3><p>The Google Pixel has always been known for its exceptional computational photography, and the 6 Pro’s camera is <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-6-pro-review/" >nothing less <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Upgrading from the now discontinued Google Pixel 5, the Pixel 6 Pro incorporates three new camera lenses and allows for up to 4X optical zoom. Housing the improved sensors is a unique visor look that now defines the Pixel phone lineup. </p><p>One standout camera feature on the Pixel 6 Pro is <strong>Motion Mode,</strong> whichallows users to capture a clear photo of a moving object, something you’d typically need a tripod for. Motion Mode includes an Action Pan option to dial up the shutter speed and capture fast-moving subjects like cars and subways. There’s also a Long Exposure option that, like Action Pan, adds a creative blur to the background for a “Pro” look and feel. </p><p>Another new and useful feature is <strong>Magic Eraser.</strong> Like Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill, the software trick allows you to magically erase unwanted objects from a photo. Using the feature is as simple as circling what you’d like to erase from your image, whether that’s strangers in the background, stain marks, or signage, and the Pixel 6 Pro does the rest. When done correctly, the image will look like it was perfectly captured in the first place. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRR3Oq03EuE?si=ZTy8-WH0AesA9zRh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-You-want-a-bigger-battery"><a href="#2-You-want-a-bigger-battery" class="headerlink" title="2. You want a bigger battery"></a>2. You want a bigger battery</h3><p>While Apple’s iPhones have made significant improvements to battery life since the early days, the Google Pixel 6 Pro wins the endurance battle. With 5,003 mAh (versus the iPhone’s suggested 3,095 mAh), the Pixel 6 Pro can withstand a day’s use with more ease than Apple’s Pro phone. Google says the Pixel 6 Pro can support up to 9 hours of YouTube playback with just a single charge, which is close to our in-house experiences. It also helps that the Pixel supports USB-C fast charging, a more standardized method of charging than Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-6-pro-review/" >One year later, Google Pixel 6 Pro is still Google’s best smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>CNET</p><h3 id="3-You-want-a-sleek-innovative-design"><a href="#3-You-want-a-sleek-innovative-design" class="headerlink" title="3. You want a sleek, innovative design"></a>3. You want a sleek, innovative design</h3><p>While the iPhone 13 Pro stuck to its traditional, stainless-steel design, only adding a larger camera bump, Google’s design broke creative boundaries, especially when compared to previous Pixel generations. Featuring a camera bar that stretches across the back, the Pixel camera doesn’t take up half of your phone like that of the iPhone 13 Pro. The bar slightly protrudes from the back glass – about 3mm from the surface – which keeps the whole device wobble-free when laid flat. </p><p>With a Gorilla Glass Victus rear and a curved aluminum-edged frame, the Pixel 6 Pro is sleek and durably built. There’s also no notch to distract you from viewing content and, instead of FaceID, the Pixel has an in-screen fingerprint scanner that has proven to function accurately. </p><p>Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro runs on the latest Android 12 software, with Android 13 on the horizon. With improved theme capabilities, new adaptive widgets, and a slew of Android perks, the Pixel software is both pleasing to the eye and practical. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HYR2NC8/ref=asc_df_B09HYR2NC81726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B09HYR2NC8&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C57fce304-91c8-406d-b367-baa5e3545f22%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro $418.88 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…"><a href="#You-should-buy-the-iPhone-13-Pro-if…" class="headerlink" title="You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…"></a>You should buy the iPhone 13 Pro if…</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un9G2_OdSRI?si=vAcGbco8DuWt4ypP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-You-want-cinematic-camera-features"><a href="#1-You-want-cinematic-camera-features" class="headerlink" title="1. You want cinematic camera features"></a>1. You want cinematic camera features</h3><p>Every year, the new “Pro” iPhone comes with a suite of camera features to justify the branding. The 13 Pro introduces a new Macro Mode for close-up shots, photographic styles for quick color overlays, and Cinematic Mode video recording. </p><p>By using the ultra-wide lens, Macro Mode lets you capture close-up shots of subjects – as close as just 2 centimeters away – while keeping things sharp and in focus. It’s a nifty camera trick that offers a different perspective than the standard wide angle. </p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-13-pro-how-to-disable-this-super-annoying-camera-feature/"><strong>How to disable this super annoying camera feature on the iPhone 13 Pro</strong></a></p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro also features new photographic styles. Different from your typical Instagram filters, these styles change how the iPhone captures photos by placing a cooler, warmer, or even black and white, digital film over the shots. This feature can save you from editing a photo after the fact.</p><p>Lastly, Cinematic Mode shoots videos with a soft, out-of-focus background so that the subject of interest and the depth map are kept separate. With AI processing, the focus can intelligently shift when the subject turns around and his or her back is then facing the camera. Overall, the special mode gives a more movie-like quality to your iPhone videos </p><h3 id="2-You-own-other-Apple-products-AirPods-Apple-Watch-iPad-MacBook-etc"><a href="#2-You-own-other-Apple-products-AirPods-Apple-Watch-iPad-MacBook-etc" class="headerlink" title="2. You own other Apple products (AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc.)"></a>2. You own other Apple products (AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook, etc.)</h3><p>There’s a reason for Apple’s cult following and customer loyalty. Its products have always followed a “strength in numbers” philosophy, enhancing existing services when more than one device is integrated. This interlocking of hardware and software is best described as Apple’s walled garden, making it difficult for users to switch out once they’re invested. </p><p>While not an actual product, the Apple ecosystem is still very much part of the product you purchase when investing in, say, an iPhone. Your Apple ID credentials serve as the ecosystem’s life source, allowing you to manage and protect multiple devices effortlessly. If you already own a pair of AirPods, an Apple Watch, or a MacBook, then buying the iPhone 13 Pro will make more sense usability-wise. </p><p>Image: Apple</p><h3 id="3-You-want-the-best-software-and-hardware-support"><a href="#3-You-want-the-best-software-and-hardware-support" class="headerlink" title="3. You want the best software and hardware support"></a>3. You want the best software and hardware support</h3><p>Along with the ecosystem, the purchase of an Apple device also comes with an extensive software update policy and an abundance of physical storefronts for customer service. Apple is known for providing timely (and somewhat <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-15-destroyed-your-iphones-battery-life-dont-panic/" >controversial) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> iOS updates for as long as seven years after an iPhone is released. Occurring every few months, Apple’s regular updates keep your device secure from bugs, security concerns, and other software flaws, while OS updates bring the latest features to your iPhone. </p><p>This support extends to the many physical Apple storefronts, equipped with customer service resources and inventory. With over 272 storefronts in the United States, alone, Apple has a variety of stores you can visit for quality assistance and maintenance.

There are many reasons why<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455" >downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you need a copy of this file, it’s best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515" >Restore ac1st16.dll from the Recycle Bin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The easiest possible cause of a “missing” ac1st16.dll file is that you’ve mistakenly deleted it.<br> If you suspect this, but you’ve already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893" >free file recovery program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480" >Start Windows in Safe Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete any of these steps if you’re unable to access Windows normally due to the error.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478" >Reinstall the program that uses the ac1st16.dll file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.<br> This file is most likely related to an older version of an <a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/" >Autodesk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> program, like<a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/viewers" >DWG TrueView <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview" >AutoCAD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (version 2006, and possibly others). However, your particular DLL file might be used with some other kind of software.<br> Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the ac1st16.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526" >Run a virus&#x2F;malware scan of your entire system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Some ac1st16.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It’s even possible that the ac1st16.dll error you’re seeing is related to a hostile program that’s masquerading as the file.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214" >Update the drivers for hardware devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that might be related to ac1st16.dll. If, for example, you’re receiving a “The file ac1st16.dll is missing” error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796" >drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >video card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> The ac1st16.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example.

Navigation apps for iOS fall into two categories: those that download maps and those that access maps on the fly.</p><p><em>If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.</em></p><p>01</p><p>of 05</p><h2 id="Apple-Maps"><a href="#Apple-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Apple Maps"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/maps/" >Apple Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/K_evkXkx8-VwMNM9OrAYu0DRf-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001-iphone-gps-apps-1683498-07a8400290564013ad8546f191a5320b.jpg"                      alt="Apple Maps app on iPhone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ECz3oZ8NrQ?si=86vkwkDJo9HQXpzt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>3D Look Around feature.</li><li>Effective lane guidance and speed limit display.</li><li>Navigation screen is free of distractions.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Doesn’t offer map downloads for offline use.</li><li>Doesn’t warn drivers of speed traps or roadway obstructions.</li></ul><p> After a rocky launch in 2012 as part of iOS 6, Apple continued to refine its Maps app until it became a worthy competitor of Google Maps on iOS devices. It ships as part of the operating system on iOS, so it’s free and instantly available to users.</p><p> The app’s attractive design provides an intuitive user interface that guides drivers, walkers, and cyclists with turn-by-turn spoken directions. It gives an arrival time by factoring in real-time traffic information and the current speed limit.</p><p> Commuters can access real-time transit information in many cities with live arrival and departure times of the user’s bus or train. On flights, get indoor maps of airport terminals, including the locations of restaurants and restrooms.</p><p> The app’s Flyover Mode and 3D city views give a Google Earth-like experience: a 3D city image to explore virtually before a trip. Add favorites and favorite locations, and enjoy proactive suggestions.</p><p> Enhancements made in the iOS 14.5 upgrade include sharing your ETA when walking or riding a bike and, via CarPlay, sharing your ETA using Siri.</p><p> In addition, safely report a traffic incident hands-free using Siri or CarPlay (in the U.S. and China). Say something like, “Siri, there’s a crash up ahead,” to report the incident without using your phone.</p><p> You can manually report an incident or a cleared incident using the Apple Maps Report an Incident screen.</p><p> Apple Maps is free and available on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad with iOS 10&#x2F;iPadOS 10 or later, Apple Watches running watchOS 2.2 and later, and Apple Vision headsets operating visionOS 1.0 or later.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/maps/id915056765" >Download Apple Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>02</p><p>of 05</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQbNyknjJJ8?si=RGVIEWLdPbvRC_r6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Google-Maps"><a href="#Google-Maps" class="headerlink" title="Google Maps"></a><a class="link"   href="https://maps.google.com/" >Google Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/On7sN_j8REvpI2GhgevdVfBYNUI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_iphone-gps-navigation-apps-1683498-5c23e7e146e0fb0001adef3e.jpg"                      alt="Google Maps screens on iOS"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Convenient voice search.

It calculates a way around traffic problems, if possible. Google Maps displays icons for construction, incidents (such as car crashes and potholes), and police presence. Color-coding indicates the amount of traffic.</p><p> The Google Maps feature list includes address and points-of-interest search using the Google Local Search utility. It offers ratings and local reviews. It also syncs searches and favorites (with a Google login). Choose from several map views: traffic, public transit, biking, satellite, terrain, or Google Earth.</p><p> Many languages are available, and you can adjust the voice guidance volume separately: softer, normal, or louder. You can also play voice prompts over Bluetooth to use your car speakers.</p><p> Google Maps is free and available for iPhone and iPod touch running iOS 15 or later, iPads running iPadOS 15 or later, and Apple Watches with watchOS 5.0 or later.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354" >Download Google Maps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>03</p><p>of 05</p><h2 id="TomTom-GO-Navigation"><a href="#TomTom-GO-Navigation" class="headerlink" title="TomTom GO Navigation"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tomtom.com/navigation/" >TomTom GO Navigation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ES5Q2dhGWfscLQaKzYs-3zvgQo4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_iphone-gps-navigation-apps-1683498-5c23e7bf46e0fb00013ca0aa.jpg"                      alt="TomTom Go screens on iOS"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>A la carte downloadable maps with weekly updates.</li><li>Excellent lane guidance.</li><li>Speed camera alerts.</li><li>Apple CarPlay compatibility.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Free app includes 50 miles of navigation per month.</li><li>After free trial, a subscription is needed for most users.</li><li>The iPhone route bar isn’t available on CarPlay.</li></ul><p> The TomTom GO Navigation app is a sleek combination of the latest TomTom car navigation technology and world-class traffic information.

The app is also preloaded with valuable points of interest.</p><p> Find destinations faster with Quick Search, which finds locations as you start typing. You can also select locations on websites or other apps by copying the URL and pasting it into Quick Search. Or, tap your favorite destination on the map, and you’re on your way.</p><p> TomTomGO Navigation is available for the iPhone and iPod touch with iOS 15 or later.

Its 4.1-pound weight isn’t ideal for a backpack or purse, but it’s much smaller than five 10,000mAh batteries would have been several years ago.</p><p> The battery is highly suitable for moving around the house, in the backyard, packed in a car, or used in any similar scenario. Its handle makes it easy to pick up. Camping might be the perfect use for this device, although keeping it around the house just for emergency power wouldn’t be out of the question.</p><p> Along the side of the battery is a light strip with low, high, and SOS lighting modes. If you only want to use it as a light, it will keep burning for 115 to 150 hours, depending on the brightness level. I liked that the battery had a light, but often forgot about it.</p><p> That’s an extreme use and would put the battery’s five USB ports to waste. Three USB-C ports flank the bottom and two USB-A ports reside above those. Depending on how many ports are in use at once will determine how much power each one is capable of putting out.</p><p> The complete diagram is complicated, but the main things you need to know are that the first USB-C port is capable of 140W out (and in), a single USB-A port can do 22.5W out, and all three USB-C ports can be used at the same time to handle 100W out each.</p><h2 id="The-Finer-Details-Are-the-Best-Parts"><a href="#The-Finer-Details-Are-the-Best-Parts" class="headerlink" title="The Finer Details Are the Best Parts"></a>The Finer Details Are the Best Parts</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/ugreen-power-bank-charging-1.jpg"                      alt="Ugreen Power Bank Charging multiple items at once"                > </p><p>Jerome Thomas &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Plenty of battery capacity, more than enough to charge a MacBook Air M2 15-inch, is great. Speedy power is fantastic too. Those are expected things though. The same is true for Ugreen’s stated safety protection against overcharging, high temperatures, or short-circuiting. Consumers just expect these batteries to be safe by default.</p><p> My favorite thing about the Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger might be its smart screen. (I think <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-post-a-link-on-instagram-stories-and-posts/" >all batteries should have displays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> though.)</p><p> The display shows its current level of charge along with in and out speeds. I don’t necessarily need to see how fast my X100VI camera is charging with a USB-C cable, but seeing its 7W light up on the display is interesting. It’s great to be able to confirm that the Ugreen battery is being re-charged at its top speed too.</p><p> If you didn’t know that most devices slow down their charging speeds as their batteries get full, you might see that first-hand on the smart display. It might have been nice to see more individualized data per USB port on the screen, or heat, but I also like the minimalism and the clean design of the small amount of data too.</p><p> It’s minor, but I also like that there are rubber feet on the bottom of the battery and the back. It can be used upright or on its back without rubbing against the surface.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-Ugreen-300W-48-000mAh-Portable-Charger"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-Ugreen-300W-48-000mAh-Portable-Charger" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger?"></a>Should You Buy Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/08/ugreen-power-bank-ports.jpg"                      alt="Close up of Ugreen Power Bank Ports"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxv4NM-89CU?si=Uj5rOkhrwZ_6QIuW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Jerome Thomas &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJY37RT3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004577&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/ugreen-300w-48000mah-portable-charger-review/&asc_campaign=Authority" >Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is supposed to be a fast, powerful, and compact battery. That’s exactly what it is. The abundance of ports makes it handy for a family spending time away from home too. Everyone can plug in at once.</p><p> The $199 retail price is a bit high, but I’ve only seen the battery on sale, usually around $169 or lower. In that case, it’s hard to beat, unless you specifically need a physically smaller, lightweight, battery to pack. Still, I like this one’s built-in light, smart display, and versatility for nearly any electronic power need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ugreen-portable-charger.jpg"                      alt="UGREEN Portable Charger"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pSRlspzW-A?si=A82G3Yxwj_31cKDq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-rec-2024-2000-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qv4Qm7kpeMs?si=9fv5SOS5a2DvixTK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Ugreen-300W-48-000mAh-Portable-Charger-1"><a href="#Ugreen-300W-48-000mAh-Portable-Charger-1" class="headerlink" title="Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger"></a>Ugreen 300W 48,000mAh Portable Charger</h5><p>9&#x2F; 10 </p><p>This portable charger has a maximum total output of 300W, PD3.1 support, 140W bidirectional charging, and five ports.
