Said tool is the Keychain Access tool which is built-into macOS and is ready to serve in the traditional user-friendly way of Apple apps. So, if you’re still not ready to jump on board the password manager trend (you should be), at least you have an option that’s ready to serve.</p><p>I’m going to show you how to open the Keychain Access tool and how to use it to locate (and even change) a saved password in macOS and even create a new Keychain item.</p><p>The only thing you’ll need to follow along is an Apple laptop or desktop. I’ll demonstrate it on a MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey (version 12.2.1). </p><p>With that said, let’s get to work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPgf_wSdhS8?si=BHoH1ryaxmwk-8FV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Opening-the-Keychain-Access-tool"><a href="#Opening-the-Keychain-Access-tool" class="headerlink" title="Opening the Keychain Access tool"></a>Opening the Keychain Access tool</h2><p>To open the Keychain Access tool, click on the Launchpad located in the Dock.

While I agree that Apple Intelligence has long-term potential, I’m not convinced that its first iteration will deliver the game-changing usability that many anticipate.</p><p>If anything, the latest iOS 18.1 betas with Apple Intelligence features have been underwhelming at best.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6X24fPKs6AE?si=YtQy-8zy7GifgfA7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-annual-upgrade-ritual"><a href="#The-annual-upgrade-ritual" class="headerlink" title="The annual upgrade ritual"></a>The annual upgrade ritual</h2><p>Every year, my wife and I eagerly await the release of the new iPhones.

Unlike typical iOS or MacOS feature upgrades, Apple Intelligence loads a downsized version of Apple’s Foundation Models, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-claims-its-on-device-ai-system-realm-substantially-outperforms-gpt-4/" >a home-grown large language model (LLM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with approximately 3 billion parameters. While impressive, this is tiny compared to models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-does-gpt-stand-for-understanding-gpt-3-5-gpt-4-and-more/" >GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which boast hundreds of billions of parameters. Even Meta’s open source Llama 3, which you can run on a desktop computer, has 8 billion parameters. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-broke-metas-llama-3-1-405b-with-one-question-which-gpt-4o-gets-right/" >I broke Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B with one question (which GPT-4o gets right) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-in-ios-18-1-developer-beta-heres-whats-new-for-iphone/" >iOS 18.1 Developer Beta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, released at the end of July, introduced the first Apple Intelligence features, but they’ve been modest so far. These include Writing Tools, which allow users to rewrite emails, texts, or letters in different tones, proofread content, and summarize or format it with tables or bullet points. Another feature provides webpage, email, or text summaries – a time-saver that cuts straight to the content. Users can also ask the Photo app to search for specific images, such as those showing someone holding a phone.</p><p>However, the integration of Apple Intelligence is not without challenges. The model, when running, may occupy between 750MB and 2GB of RAM, depending on how effective Apple’s memory compression technology is. This substantial allocation of memory to a core OS function that won’t always be used means that parts must be dynamically loaded in and out of memory as required, introducing new system constraints and potentially putting additional stress on the CPU.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-run-dozens-of-ai-models-on-your-mac-or-pc-no-third-party-cloud-needed/"><strong>How to run dozens of AI models on your Mac or PC - no third-party cloud needed</strong></a></p><p>More advanced AI features, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/" >Genmoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for creating custom emoji, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-dall-e-apples-new-ai-image-generator-runs-on-device-and-works-like-magic/" >Image Playground <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for on-device image creation, and ChatGPT integration, have yet to be included in the beta.

The <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-15-plus-review/" >base iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has only 6GB of RAM, would struggle to meet the demands of Apple Intelligence as it evolves and becomes more integrated into iOS, core Apple applications, and developer applications. Older iPhones have <a class="link"   href="https://iosref.com/ram-processor" >6GB of RAM or less <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and are not eligible to run Apple Intelligence in current iOS 18.1 builds. </p><p>Due to their 8GB of onboard RAM, only the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max can run Apple Intelligence, and it is strictly a beta feature that can be enabled or disabled at user preference within Settings.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/" >iOS 18.1 update: Every iPhone model that will support Apple’s new AI features (for now) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Recent leaks have <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-16-leak-just-spilled-the-specs-and-prices-on-all-four-models" >spilled the specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of the iPhone 16 lineup, providing a clearer picture of what to expect. The base iPhone 16 is expected to feature the A18 processor with 8GB of RAM, while the iPhone 16 Pro models might sport the A18 Pro with up to 12GB of RAM, although <a class="link"   href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-17-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb/" >recent rumors indicate this may be rolled out for iPhone 17 instead <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This increase in memory is crucial, considering the demanding nature of Apple Intelligence features. However, whether it will fully address performance concerns remains to be seen.</p><p>Interestingly, despite these hardware upgrades, Apple appears to be keeping prices similar to those of the iPhone 15 series, with the base iPhone 16 starting at $799. The iPhone 16 Pro, however, is rumored to start at $1,099, a $100 increase from its predecessor, likely due to the additional storage and upgraded components. The Pro models are also expected to introduce Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, a new telephoto lens, and larger screens – 6.3 inches for the Pro and 6.9 inches for the Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/" >Apple Intelligence will improve Siri in 2024, but don’t expect most updates until 2025 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Despite these upgrades, the iPhone 16 may still face challenges due to design cycles that didn’t fully account for the scope of Apple Intelligence’s capabilities. As a result, users may experience suboptimal performance and a less seamless user experience, especially as more AI features roll out in subsequent updates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV3vm805eX0?si=YSPcsFxBcJmoxLsU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-you-shouldn’t-buy-the-iPhone-16-for-Apple-Intelligence"><a href="#Why-you-shouldn’t-buy-the-iPhone-16-for-Apple-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 16 for Apple Intelligence"></a>Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 16 for Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Besides memory concerns, AI processing demands a lot of power and additional computing resources. Without significant advancements in battery and power management technology, users might have to charge their phones more often. This can lead to increased battery drain, reduced battery lifespan, and potential performance issues. The extra processing power needed to run on-device LLMs could strain the CPU, causing the device to heat up and affecting its overall performance and reliability.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-ios-18-changes-the-way-you-charge-your-iphone/" >How iOS 18 changes the way you charge your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For these reasons, I see the iPhone 16 (and potentially even the iPhone 17) as a transitional product in Apple’s journey toward on-device AI. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Apple-Intelligence-will-likely-evolve"><a href="#How-Apple-Intelligence-will-likely-evolve" class="headerlink" title="How Apple Intelligence will likely evolve"></a>How Apple Intelligence will likely evolve</h2><p>Apple’s AI capabilities are expected to improve significantly in the coming years. By 2025, we may see more advanced and dependable integration of Apple Intelligence not only in mobile devices and Macs, but also in products like the Apple Watch, HomePod, Apple TV, and a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-rescue-the-vision-pro-apple-must-do-these-3-things/" >consumer-oriented version of the Vision headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To extend Apple Intelligence to these less powerful devices, as the company is doing with its “Private Cloud Compute” by running <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-building-a-high-security-os-to-run-its-ai-data-centers-heres-what-we-know-so-far/" >secure Darwin-based servers in their data centers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more advanced LLM processing, Apple might leverage cloud-based resources for these less-powerful systems through fully developed data center capabilities and partnerships with companies like OpenAI or Google.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-rescue-the-vision-pro-apple-must-do-these-3-things/" >To rescue the Vision Pro, Apple must do these 3 things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Alternatively, Apple could consider a distributed or “mesh” AI processing system, where idle devices within a household or enterprise can assist less powerful ones with LLM queries.</p><p>Apple could achieve this by equipping MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS with Apple Intelligence and the on-device LLM as planned. Subsequent changes could enable all devices to communicate their generative AI capabilities and idle processing state. This would allow them to act as proxies for each other’s Apple Intelligence requests. </p><p>Enterprises may also employ a mobile device management solution to facilitate access to on-device LLMs with business Macs. Additionally, iPhones or Macs could be used as proxies for Apple Watch or HomePod requests for mobile users. We may also see a more powerful Apple TV with more onboard memory and processing to act as an Apple Intelligence “hub” for every Apple device in a household.</p><p>Imagine your iPhone using the unused processing power of your Mac or iPad, all equipped with on-device LLMs, to tackle complex AI tasks. This would increase the accessibility of AI features across Apple’s product range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="I’m-still-optimistic"><a href="#I’m-still-optimistic" class="headerlink" title="I’m still optimistic"></a>I’m still optimistic</h2><p>Despite the hype around Apple Intelligence, there are many other reasons to consider upgrading to the iPhone 16, like improvements in camera quality, display, and overall performance. The iPhone 16 will likely feature better sensors, enhanced computational photography, and superior video capabilities. The display might also see improvements in brightness, color accuracy, and refresh rate, making it a better device for media consumption and gaming. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-may-be-cooking-something-big-with-its-new-game-mode-here-are-3-things-we-know/" >Apple may be cooking something big with its new Game Mode.

I spent about half of the year using both units. I had my Mint Mobile eSIM installed on the smaller iPhone 15 for the first three months and then transferred to the iPhone 15 Plus for the other half. A good part of my long-term evaluation process includes testing cellular connectivity (read: using the devices in crowded areas, on top of buildings, in subways, and more), day-to-day performance, and taking more photos than a standard free subscription to iCloud can contain.</p><p>The difference between the two latest iPhone handsets mainly boils down to display size and battery life; unlike the Pro models, there’s no camera hardware discrepancy, which means the general user experience of the two is pleasantly similar. That made my life as a phone reviewer a little easier – and makes the list below all the more applicable to both iPhone models.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features"><a href="#What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features" class="headerlink" title="What are the iPhone 15’s best features?"></a>What are the iPhone 15’s best features?</h2><p><strong>Thinner, lighter form factor:</strong> Without question, the most important aspect of a phone is how it feels in hand – we carry these things around everywhere, all the time – and with the latest iPhone, it’s baffling how much more premium it feels compared to previous generations. Whether you’re coming from an iPhone XR or an iPhone 14, the glossy, sharp-cornered form factor of old pales compared to Apple’s new design language, which flaunts contoured edges and a color-infused, satin backing. Apple has always kept the matte finish exclusive to its Pro line, so I’m all for the iPhone 15 being a little more disruptive.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Less is more here, and Apple’s slimming down of the base-level iPhone has made it so comfortable in my hand that I didn’t – and still don’t – envy the Pro model’s titanium material one bit. The iPhone 15 also comes in more charming colors than the Pro line, with pastel – and emphasis on “pastel” – hues of green, yellow, pink, blue, and black. For me, matte black is king, easily matching my favorite (though flawed) <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/matte-black-iphone-7-paint-problems-if-its-finish-is-flaking-off-youre-not-alone/" >iPhone finish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all time.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Island:</strong> The most notable display upgrade with the iPhone 15 is the Dynamic Island, carried over from the previous year’s iPhone 14 Pro. (The brighter 2,000-nit display comes in a close second.) It’s a feature that everyone can appreciate – whether you end up using it or not – because, unlike the notch that it replaced, the Dynamic Island turns that chunk of previously unused real estate into a glanceable status indicator system. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/" >Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 6 for Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You don’t <em>have</em> to interact with the Spotify music player or Uber Eats tracker that magically morphs into the pill-shaped cutout to appreciate its functionality. If you do, though, you’ll be glad you no longer have to open an app just to skip a track or know how much further away your game-day pizzas are. I’ve enjoyed using the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy-beautiful-sun-tracker/id908905093" >Lumy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, which displays a timer for when golden hour ends, so I know exactly how long I have left to take those warm and dreamy photos before sunset.</p><p><strong>USB-C</strong> <strong>port:</strong> This one should be more straightforward than it seems, but Apple’s crisscrossing of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-15s-usb-c-upgrade-may-have-serious-implications-for-the-charging-accessory-future/" >charging standards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and data transfer speeds means that it’s not. While the iPhone 15 now supports the universal USB-C port, meaning I no longer have to wrestle through my car’s center console for a Lightning cable or <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-cables-for-the-iphone-15/" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on what phone I’m using, it’s not as powerful and fast as the one on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>The iPhone 15 can also charge other phones and accessories, including this SmallRig video light that I use when filming.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The result is a slower charging rate (up to 18W) and data transfer speed (up to 480Mbps), which I haven’t found to be deal-breakers. Part of the reason is that the iPhone 15 Plus, in particular, has been an absolute endurance beast, lasting me well into a second workday before needing to be charged. It even beats the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s battery life, as reported by numerous testers.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ios-18-public-beta-is-available-for-iphone-right-now-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/" >The iOS 18 public beta is available for iPhone right now. How to download it (and which models support it) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Naturally, I’ve been topping it up when I’m deep at work or cooking, when how quickly the phone charges is the least of my worries. (Second note: The smaller iPhone 15’s battery life has been less spectacular, netting me well under a day of usage.) I’ve also gotten so used to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/how-to-airdrop/" >using AirDrop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and cloud services for file transfers, especially for time-sensitive photos and videos captured at press events, that the slower data transfer speed is insignificant to my workflow. </p><p><strong>48-megapixel camera:</strong> Speaking of which, both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a new 48MP main camera that defaults to 24MP capturing (by combining the low-light capabilities of a 12MP binned photo and the detail of the 48MP), and I was satisfied with its output. The iPhone’s color science leans more natural, prioritizing the finer details like subjects underneath shadows and how evenly lit everything in the frame is.</p><p>Here’s the Wythe Hotel captured with the iPhone 15 Plus’ 12-megapixel ultrawide lens.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The image above, when captured on a Samsung Galaxy S23 or a OnePlus 11, made the sky more blue, the trees unnaturally vibrant, and the traffic lights a more polarizing neon yellow. Of course, which camera output is better comes down to personal preference, and in some cases, I actually prefer the more processed but ready-to-share stills that I get from a competing <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/" >Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-decluttered-my-iphone-and-freed-up-gigs-of-space-heres-how/" >I decluttered my iPhone and freed up gigs of space. Here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The iPhone 15’s 48MP camera can also function as a telephoto lens with a 2x zoom. Apple calls it a 2x “optical” zoom, but from what I’ve seen when comparing the optically zoomed photo to one I manually cropped in, the difference is negligible. As for low-light photography, I’m glad to see Apple embracing the darkness and not making an otherwise moody, sunsetting environment look like the middle of the day, as depicted below.</p><p>Tip: iOS 17 gives you a leveler in the camera app to help you frame and straighten photos just right.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>With the iPhone 15’s camera system, its video capabilities stand out to me the most. Of all the phones I’ve tested, nothing comes close to the raw output that I get from an iPhone camera, from the image stabilization that doesn’t make a buzzing effect every step that I take to how consistent colors are when switching between the main wide lens to the ultrawide.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone"><a href="#Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?"></a>Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?</h2><p>It’s true that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-users-keep-their-phones-longer-than-android-owners/" >consumers are now upgrading their smartphones at a slower rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, spending three years or more with their devices before switching to the next best thing. If you’re coming from an older iPhone model, here’s how it stacks up with the iPhone 15 and the biggest differences you can expect.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>If you’re upgrading from…</strong></th><th><strong>The biggest differences are…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>iPhone X or iPhone XR</strong></td><td>If you’re coming from an iPhone X, you’ll now be able to experience iOS 17, which features StandBy Mode, Contact Posters, Live Voicemail, Interactive widgets, and more.

See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 12</strong></td><td>For iPhone Mini users, the standard iPhone 15 is your best bet if you still want a relatively compact form factor with all the latest iOS perks. The iPhone 15 also comes with a base storage of 128GB, double that of the iPhone 12. See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 13</strong></td><td>Prepare to convert your physical SIM card to an eSIM. You’ll also gain access to Apple’s Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection safety features. See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 14</strong></td><td>The Dynamic Island, 48MP camera, thinner design, and USB-C port are the most notable upgrades from the iPhone 14. And, assuming you’ve converted to eSIM, the contacts transferring process should be very seamless.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPgf_wSdhS8?si=BHoH1ryaxmwk-8FV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model"><a href="#What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model" class="headerlink" title="What I’d like to see in the next model"></a>What I’d like to see in the next model</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p><strong>90Hz refresh rate, if not 120Hz:</strong> My biggest critique of the iPhone 15 is its display refresh rate. Not everyone will notice the difference between a 60Hz panel and a 120Hz panel, but as someone who carries a secondary Android phone at all times, it’s hard not to acknowledge the less fluid iPhone display. This may also be a dealbreaker if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro and have gotten used to the Pro Motion panels.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-uncovered-8-cool-ways-to-use-lidar-on-an-iphone-and-ipad/" >I uncovered 8 cool ways to use LiDAR on an iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is this Apple’s way of splitting up the non-Pro and Pro models? Probably. I don’t take for granted that fewer animations mean the iPhone 15 is more battery efficient than the Pro, but in a world where even sub-$200 phones have 120Hz displays, I really wish that Apple gave its $800 iPhone something smoother on the eyes.</p><p><strong>An Action button:</strong> Given how many iPhone 14 Pro features Apple carried over to the iPhone 15, I have my fingers crossed that Apple will replace the alert slider with the Action button this year. Over the course of testing the latest iPhones, I’ve used the alert slider less than a dozen times. An Action button would give the iPhone much more functionality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDNwgyE0nbY?si=3k_WBhpIw3WudJot" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-thought"><a href="#Final-thought" class="headerlink" title="Final thought"></a>Final thought</h2><p>It’s easy to call the standard iPhone model the “Best iPhone for most people.” That’s been the case since Apple introduced a Pro variant with the iPhone 11 series, and still holds true with the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only now, I’m finding myself recommending the non-Pro iPhone to more users than ever before, including folks I’ve known to be more demanding of their tech.

Just like iPhones and cases, Apple Watches can be upgraded and customized for many situations, from casual to dressy, thanks to their interchangeable watch bands. </p><p>I’ve been an <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> user for a few years now, and I recently upgraded from a Series 3 watch to the latest <a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2nd-Gen-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-S-M-Fitness-Sleep-Tracker-Crash-Detection-Heart-Rate-Monitor/5033741510?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >Watch SE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Over the last several months, I’ve embarked on a journey to test Apple Watch bands from brands like Apple, Nomad, Spigen, and more, to find the best watch bands made of materials ranging from stainless steel to fabric to leather. I’ve also included input from other ZDNET experts who frequently try different watch bands and switch up their looks and consulted staff and customer reviews for bands across the market. Every pick on this list is backed by hands-on testing  staff. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"><strong>The best Apple Watches you can buy</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now"><a href="#What’s-the-best-Apple-Watch-band-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?"></a>What’s the best Apple Watch band right now?</h2><p>After months of wearing different bands during my daily activities and considering the rest of the ZDNET staff’s extensive hands-on analysis of watch bands, my pick for the best Apple Watch band overall is <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-black" >Nomad’s Sport Band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> thanks to its comfortable and breathable wear and its numerous color choices, including limited edition drops, for a nice upgrade over the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWMR3AM/A/41mm-soft-mint-sport-band-s-m?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >plain sports band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that came with my Apple Watch.</p><p>Not looking for a sport band pick?

It is designed for intense workouts and everyday wear. Plus, it’s 100% waterproof, so you can wear it as you exercise in rain, sleet, or snow without worrying about damage. Its lightweight design that encourages ventilation has also solved my sweaty gym wrists (if you know, you know). </p><p>If you’re looking to purchase a sport band or you love Nomad’s bands, we recommend keeping an eye on their website because the company regularly offers Limited Edition models with cool colors and styles (including the one pictured above on my Apple Watch SE). These historically sell out quickly, so if you see a limited edition offering, it’s smart to make your purchase quickly.</p><p>I tested the Nomad Sport band in the limited edition glow-in-the-dark Glow 2.0 design, and I was impressed with how similar it felt and performed to my original Apple sport band. Although not every sport band features this fun glow, they all offer the same features. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/nomads-glow-in-the-dark-iphone-case-just-sold-out-but-its-alternatives-are-just-as-good/"><strong>Nomad’s glow-in-the-dark iPhone case just sold out, but its alternatives are just as good</strong></a></p><p>When I tested the Nomad sport band, I liked the durable yet comfortable material, the numerous color options available, the customizable adjustability, and the overall look of the band. Getting the band initially secured was a little difficult, but over time, I got it on and off quickly. It’s a nice upgrade from the standard Apple band, and should work for most people. Since it offers more notch options, it felt more secure on my wrist than the Apple sport band, and I felt it stayed cleaner than my Apple band typically does. </p><p>I only have two issues with this band. The first is that after a few weeks of wear, the coating on the stainless steel pin started coming off, although it isn’t noticeable unless I look very closely. Secondly, despite the numerous color options, I wish Nomad offered more, like some softer pastels.</p><p>Nomad sport band customers on <a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16ldce5/are%5Fnomad%5Fstraps%5Fany%5Fgood/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> said they liked the quality, color options (including limited edition designs), and overall value of the band. Some customers said the band did not sit flush with the Apple Watch Ultra, and one customer said the stainless steel pin broke off their band (although they reported customer service promptly replaced their purchase). </p><p><strong>Nomad Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://burga.sjv.io/c/159047/1270603/15631?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%253A%252F%252Fus.burga.com%252Fproducts%252Fall-eyes-on-me-apple-watch-band&subId1=zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp" >View now at Burga <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Two-tone design</li><li>Similar feel to jewelry watch</li><li>Clasp closure</li><li>Affordable luxury</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Clasp can sometimes clip skin</li><li>Requires careful wear&#x2F;proper care</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C51hzX46eY?si=o5qiDSkT7mXUGm3F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band"><a href="#Burga-Stainless-Steel-Two-Tone-Apple-Watch-Band" class="headerlink" title="Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band"></a>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch Band</h2><h3 id="Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style"><a href="#Best-metal-Apple-Watch-band-for-style" class="headerlink" title="Best metal Apple Watch band for style"></a>Best metal Apple Watch band for style</h3><p>Since I began exploring Apple watch bands, I’ve been searching for one that I can use to dress up my everyday look. This Burga watch band offers a two-tone stainless steel strap and an easy clasp closure. The inside is designed for comfort, and the band can support everyday wear and tear.</p><p>When I tested this Burga watch over a few weeks, I was immediately impressed with its overall appearance. It looked expensive and of quality, echoing the same look as a non-smart watch. It has a nice weight, and it was easy to follow the adjustment instructions to fit it to my wrist. </p><p>Throughout testing, I received several compliments on this band – which doesn’t often happen despite the number of products I test through my work, and I was happy with the affordable luxury look it gave my Watch SE. I had no issues with tarnishing or chipping after my few weeks of wear, although I was careful around water, did not wear the band while applying lotion, makeup, or perfume, and used a jewelry cloth to wipe it down every few wears or so. I also did not wear this band during intense workouts, but it was fine during my casual walks, usually 3-5 miles daily. </p><p>With proper care, this watch band offers great value. It looks much more expensive than it is, and it is worth the money if you’re looking to switch up your look for a special occasion or a few times a week. It is slightly pricier than bands made of less expensive materials but significantly less expensive than titanium options. </p><p>Current Burga customers said they liked this watch band’s overall design and quality, with some saying it looks and feels like an affordable luxury. </p><p><strong>Burga Stainless Steel Two-Tone Apple Watch band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> No | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> All current Apple Watch models | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 42mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm&#x2F;49mm or 38mm&#x2F;40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-slim-band-white-41mm" >View now at Nomad Goods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Durable</li><li>High quality</li><li>Interior ventilation</li><li>Slim profile</li><li>Good for small wrists</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Limited color options</li><li>Slight wear on stainless steel pin</li><li>A little pricey</li></ul><h2 id="Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nomad-Slim-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Slim Sport Band"></a>Nomad Slim Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band"><a href="#Best-slim-everyday-Apple-Watch-band" class="headerlink" title="Best slim everyday Apple Watch band"></a>Best slim everyday Apple Watch band</h3><p>Nomad’s slim sport band is a thinner version of the brand’s sport band. Though it features a similar design, material, and overall feel, the slim band has a thinner construction and a smaller overall look on the wearer’s wrist. </p><p>Like the classic sport band, the slim band is 100% waterproof, features a lightweight design that encourages ventilation, and is made of the same durable material. I was able to test the slim sport band for several weeks with my Apple Watch SE in starlight, and I liked how similar in color and feel it was to the Apple-issue sport band that came with my watch. </p><p>When I tested the band, I was also impressed with how secure the stainless steel pin kept the watch despite its more delicate profile. I prefer the slim band over Nomad’s classic sport band for everyday wear, though I can understand why this style may not be the best for someone with larger wrists or a desire for a more prominent watch band. </p><p>Like the sport band, it was a little tough to put on at first, but it became easier to do so the more I wore it. I have also seen some chipping on the stainless steel pin’s coating, and like with the sport band, I wish there were more color options. Since the slim band is my preferred style, it’s a bit of a disappointment that there are only four color options, especially when the larger sport band has quite a bit more and limited edition offerings. I’d love to see more punchy colors and some soft pastels in the slim band – it’s a great option for often smaller women’s wrists. </p><p>Regardless of my feelings about the color selection, I enjoyed testing the slim band, and since then, I’ve been frequently wearing it in my daily activities. </p><p><strong>Nomad Slim Sport Band features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Fluoroelastomer rubber | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch Ultra, Series 9, 8, 7, 6, SE, and all previous versions of Apple Watch <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 45mm&#x2F;49mm or 40mm&#x2F;41mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-series-band-liquid-crystal-pro" >View now at Spigen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crytal-Designed-Crystal/dp/B098SX92FT?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca7f5b19e-ab8f-44af-b235-be9236babbdf%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Truly clear</li><li>Case and band combo</li><li>Easy to take on and off</li><li>Easy to insert watch</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Needs breaking in</li><li>Silicone not the most malleable</li></ul><h2 id="Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band"><a href="#Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Pro-Apple-Watch-Case-and-Band" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band"></a>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch Case and Band</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU08CQVsZz0?si=V-SvPfzRsQysMS0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band"><a href="#Best-clear-Apple-Watch-case-and-band" class="headerlink" title="Best clear Apple Watch case and band"></a>Best clear Apple Watch case and band</h3><p>Spigen’s Liquid Proband is both an Apple watch strap and a case in one. Simply pop in your Apple Watch and fasten it to your wrist – you don’t have to deal with sliding any bands in. The Liquid Pro is available in crystal clear and black space clear colors. </p><p>It is made of soft silicone for comfort, fastens with a traditional buckle, and features a unibody design. I wasn’t expecting to like this band and case combo as much as I did. While I don’t think I’d consider this for myself for everyday wear, this is a great option for kids thanks to its all-in-one approach or for those looking to minimize the appearance of their watch thanks to the crystal clear design. </p><p>When I tested this watch band over a few months, I liked how easy it was to pop my watch in and out of this case yet how secure it remained. I also liked that the built-in case provided extra protection around my watch. The watch band itself is pretty comfortable overall, though the silicone wasn’t extremely malleable and is still a bit stiff. I predict that over more daily wear, it will eventually contour more to one’s wrist, but it definitely needs breaking in. </p><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Pro Apple Watch features:</strong> <strong>Material:</strong> Silicone | <strong>Waterproof:</strong> Yes | <strong>Compatibility:</strong> Apple Watch | <strong>Band sizes:</strong> 40mm&#x2F;44mm&#x2F;45mm</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp/https://www.nike.com/w/apple-watch-nike-sport-band-7dq6d" >View now at Nike <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUV53AM/A/45mm-midnight-sky-nike-sport-band-m-l&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Breathes well</li><li>Durable</li><li>Fun colors</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Dust and residue collect in the holes</li><li>Requires cleaning</li></ul><h2 id="Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band"><a href="#Nike-Apple-Watch-Sport-Band" class="headerlink" title="Nike Apple Watch Sport Band"></a>Nike Apple Watch Sport Band</h2><h3 id="Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative"><a href="#Best-classic-Apple-Watch-band-alternative" class="headerlink" title="Best classic Apple Watch band alternative"></a>Best classic Apple Watch band alternative</h3><p>Nike’s flagship sports band is the athletic brand’s take on the classic Apple sports band.

Often, Apple Watch bands from third-party brands are sized according to the display size of your watch, such as 40mm, 45mm, 49mm, etc, but they are not necessarily your watch model. Some bands may also have wrist-size options, such as Apple’s flagship sport bands, which are S&#x2F;M and M&#x2F;L, but other options don’t specify wrist sizes (they ensure adjustability for a great fit). Be sure you know what band size and potentially what wrist size you need.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: A purchase is hardly worth it if your Apple Watch band breaks or cracks, so it’s important to consider the long-term durability while searching for watch bands. We don’t want you to waste your cash on cheap options, so we’ve tested the picks on this list before recommending them.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: As with other purchases, what you’re willing to spend is critical. Establishing a budget can help narrow down your search parameters and ensure you’re purchasing within your comfort range. Keep in mind that the material will often drive the cost of Apple Watch bands up. Several metal band options on this list, particularly the titanium options, are over $100.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> If you’re purchasing a watch band, you might want it to be comfortable. When I tested watch bands over the last several months, I considered comfort on my own wrist before recommending anything on this list. Your watch band must be secure, too, especially if you’re using your watch during intense workouts or for heart rate monitoring.</li></ul><h2 id="How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands"><a href="#How-did-we-test-these-best-Apple-Watch-bands" class="headerlink" title="How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?"></a>How did we test these best Apple Watch bands?</h2><p>We went hands-on with every Apple Watch band on this list before selecting and recommending our picks. I conducted hands-on testing over several months on over a dozen watch bands and incorporated even more analysis and hands-on testing  staff. </p><p>We spent time wearing these bands in our day-to-day lives, during work, errands, workouts, and more to get a feel for each band’s comfort, security, adjustability, and more – not just for a day or two, but over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for each product’s add-in value. Can you “add” this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that’s too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? </p><p>If we think another product is worth your money, we’ll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it’s for. </p><p>Plus, we routinely scour the web for new products worthy of testing, follow news on product rollouts and upgrades, and source the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that’s why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and budget. Our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted. </p><h2 id="How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy"><a href="#How-do-I-know-what-size-Apple-Watch-band-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?"></a>How do I know what size Apple Watch band to buy?</h2><p>Before buying the best Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch, you need to know which size to buy. If you are not sure, Apple provides a convenient <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide%5FCA.pdf" >sizing template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you can use to check sizing. However, most bands today from non-Apple brands are adjustable and customizable for fit, so the band size isn’t of consideration. I only needed to remove links for the metal options I tested the last few months – for every other band option, I could self-adjust easily. </p><p>The most important factor is to confirm that your Apple Watch works with your chosen band to ensure a seamless fit when putting the two together. This means if you have a 49mm watch, you want to look for a band that specifies that size. Essentially, just know what model and display size you purchased for your watch, and you’ll be okay. </p><h2 id="How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-the-best-Apple-Watch-bands-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?"></a>How much do the best Apple Watch bands cost?</h2><p>The cost of Apple Watch bands can run the gamut, ranging from around $30 to upwards of hundreds of dollars. Many metal bands can easily bring you into the hundreds – Nomad’s titanium band is a whopping $300, and iterations of Apple’s Milanese Loop can get pricey, too. However, most of the picks on this list are under $100 and sit comfortably between the $30-$80 range.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple"><a href="#What-are-the-different-Apple-Watch-bands-available-from-Apple" class="headerlink" title="What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?"></a>What are the different Apple Watch bands available from Apple?</h2><p>Apple offers several band options that are included with its watches, some dependent on the model purchased. The most frequent band options, often included with new Apple watches like the Series 9, are the Sport Band and Sport Loop, available in several colors, such as Midnight, Starlight, White, Red, Pink, and more. </p><p>Other band options include the Ocean Band, Alpine Loop, Milanese Loop, Trail Loop, Solo Loop, Braided Solo Loop, and more. Apple and other retailers offer tons of bands made of differing materials in a multitude of colors and designs as well. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-newest-Apple-Watch"><a href="#What-is-the-newest-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="What is the newest Apple Watch?"></a>What is the newest Apple Watch?</h2><p>Apple has a lengthy lineup of Apple Watches, with several iterations over the last few years. The two newest watch releases are the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which were released in September 2023. The Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) remains the most up-to-date base model. With multiple old and new models available, you’ll be sure to find a watch that fits your needs and your price point. </p><h2 id="Do-Apple-Watches-track-my-AFib"><a href="#Do-Apple-Watches-track-my-AFib" class="headerlink" title="Do Apple Watches track my AFib?"></a>Do Apple Watches track my AFib?</h2><p>Yes, your Apple Watch, as long as it is a Series 6 or newer, can track your AFib or irregular heartbeat. In fact, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently awarded the status of medical device development tool (MDDT) to the Apple Watch’s atrial fibrillation (AFib) history tracker.

In <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120431" >a support page update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Apple announced that “Apple Pay is no longer offering new loans for purchases with Apple Pay.”</p><p>Apple launched <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-buy-now-pay-later-service-is-rolling-out-to-select-users-right-now/" >Apple Pay Later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in October 2023 to let its users fund purchases via monthly payments. Through the service, you could request a loan amount between $50 and $1,000 to pay for your purchase. With the loan amount split into four payments over six weeks, you’d make the first payment at checkout, with the three remaining payments charged to your debit card every two weeks. The major benefit was that your Apple Pay Later loan carried no interest charges.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-apple-pay-in-stores-and-online/" >How to use Apple Pay in stores and online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Although Apple is retiring the service, you can pay off your loans as you have until now:</p><ul><li>If you currently have an active loan, continue to make each payment according to the due date. If your loan is set to autopay, Apple will automatically charge the debit card you used for all future payments.</li><li>If you bought an item that hasn’t shipped yet, your first payment will be debited after the retailer processes your order. You’ll then make the remaining three payments every two weeks.</li><li>If you’ve returned an item or are waiting for a refund, the retailer will notify Apple Pay Later, which will then apply the refund to any payments you owe.</li></ul><p>On its support page, Apple didn’t reveal why it’s retiring Apple Pay Later. In a <a class="link"   href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/" >statement sent to 9to5Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, however, the company touted an alternative option set to roll out later in 2024, likely in line with the release of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 in the fall. </p><p>“Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay,” Apple said in its statement.</p><p>“With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the US,” the company explained. “Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>At its WWDC 2024 conference last week, Apple revealed more details about its upcoming installment option.</p><p>“Apple Pay introduces even more flexibility and choice for users when they check out online and in-app,” the company said in <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/new-features-come-to-apple-services-this-fall/" >a news release <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. “Users can view and redeem rewards, and access installment loan offerings from eligible credit or debit cards, when making a purchase online or in-app with iPhone and iPad. These features will be available for any Apple Pay-enabled bank or issuer to integrate in supported markets.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-will-let-you-use-apple-pay-on-any-browser-on-any-pc/" >iOS 18 will let you use Apple Pay on any browser on any PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Apple plans to roll out the installment option to a few countries, including Australia with ANZ (The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group), Spain with CaixaBank, and the UK with HSBC and Monzo. In the US, people will be able to apply for loans through Citi and Synchrony, as well as with banks and credit unions that use Fiserv. US consumers who check out with Apple Pay will also be able to request loans directly through “buy now, pay later” service <a class="link"   href="https://www.affirm.com/shopping/stores/apple" >Affirm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>From Apple’s description, the new installment plans offer a couple of benefits over Apple Pay Later. First, you’ll be able to use either a credit or debit card to fund your purchases (Apple Pay Later was limited to only debit cards). Second, the installment option will be accessible globally, while Apple Pay Later was available only in the US.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-recommending-the-standard-iphone-16-over-the-pro-this-year-and-im-not-alone/"  title="Why I&#39;m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I&#39;m not alone)">Why I’m recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-onedrive-messing-with-your-files-how-to-get-your-windows-storage-under-control/"  title="Is OneDrive messing with your files?

As we delve deeper into this issue, it becomes clear that Apple’s journey from celebrated innovator to being at the center of legal crosshairs encapsulates a broader regulatory and public perception shift. </p><p>Let’s explore the potential consequences of Apple’s antitrust lawsuit and what it means for its market dominance and control over the app ecosystem and mobile and services platforms.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pGHmqD53gc8?si=ymgHIB6Aa7_MoUUf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Apple-user-experience-at-a-crossroads"><a href="#The-Apple-user-experience-at-a-crossroads" class="headerlink" title="The Apple user experience at a crossroads"></a>The Apple user experience at a crossroads</h2><p>The success of the lawsuit against Apple could result in an era where users have more choices, including access to alternative app stores and many apps outside of Apple’s curated selection. </p><p>If Apple is required to adopt a more open system due to the antitrust lawsuit, user experience (UX) on Apple devices could undergo significant changes. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>A more diverse app ecosystem:</strong> Users may encounter a broader range of previously unavailable apps (such as Google’s Chromium web browser engine) due to Apple’s strict approval processes. This could lead to more innovative app functionalities.</li><li><strong>Customization options:</strong> The ability to sideload apps could lead to more personalized device setups, allowing users to customize their experience according to their preferences without being limited to the App Store’s selection.</li><li><strong>Payment flexibility:</strong> If Apple is required to allow alternative payment systems, users may benefit from more competitive pricing, discounts, and offers directly from developers, bypassing Apple’s standard fees.</li><li><strong>Direct developer interaction:</strong> Sideloading could facilitate a more direct relationship between app developers and users, improving customer service and feedback mechanisms.</li><li><strong>Enhanced consumer choice:</strong> Users could have more choices in default apps for messaging, browsing, and more, diminishing Apple’s ability to set default service preferences.</li></ul><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0b9szh8vEk?si=NlGzpJ6MN_SJNk5A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Security-and-privacy-implications"><a href="#Security-and-privacy-implications" class="headerlink" title="Security and privacy implications"></a>Security and privacy implications</h2><p>However, this newfound freedom within Apple’s platforms may come with certain complexities, as users must balance the excitement of diversity with the apprehension of potential security and privacy risks. </p><p>Expanding user options and improving pricing through App Store changes might lead to a more intricate app landscape, requiring users to understand app permissions and security at a much more granular level than previously. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/" >The best VPN services for iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>If the DOJ prevails in its lawsuit, sideloading will be a prime vector of security concern for Apple’s devices. </p><p>Sideloading increases the risk of malware infections, phishing attacks, data leakage, and delayed security patches. Users may unknowingly install apps with malicious code, which could compromise their devices and steal their data. Apps outside of Apple’s ecosystem may not follow the company’s stringent privacy standards, making users more vulnerable to phishing attacks. </p><p>Sideloading could circumvent iOS’s privacy controls, allowing apps to access and share user data without proper oversight. Apps obtained outside of the App Store might not receive timely updates, exposing users to unpatched security vulnerabilities.</p><p>But there is a potential positive side. Allowing sideloading could ensure that Apple’s privacy and security practices are not used anti-competitively. This could help maintain genuine user protection, which is crucial to maintaining user trust and safeguarding the platform’s integrity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6lCtLUeROA?si=se6OFuis9JpcTGJf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="App-Store-changes"><a href="#App-Store-changes" class="headerlink" title="App Store changes"></a>App Store changes</h2><p>Apple’s financial model heavily depends on App Store commissions, which may undergo significant changes due to this lawsuit, judgment, or settlement. These changes could lead to a more dynamic market, providing consumers with more competitive pricing and a wider range of innovative app offerings. Fundamentally, it could alter the economic structure of the entire digital marketplace.</p><p>Following antitrust actions, Apple’s market dynamics could shift in several ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduction in App Store fees:</strong> Antitrust rulings may require Apple to reduce its upfront commission and yearly subscription fee, which could negatively impact its revenue. However, this may lead to lower app prices for consumers and increased developer earnings.</li><li><strong>Competitive app marketplace:</strong> If iOS is opened to third-party app stores, it could break Apple’s monopoly on app distribution and create a more competitive environment where different app marketplaces fight for developer and consumer attention.</li><li><strong>Innovative business models:</strong> If Apple’s control is broken, it could encourage innovation as developers will have the freedom to explore new app functionalities and business models. They can experiment with alternative monetization strategies beyond the traditional app purchase or subscription model, such as enhanced in-app advertising, freemium models, or blockchain-based transactions.</li></ul><h2 id="Apple-ecosystem-transformation"><a href="#Apple-ecosystem-transformation" class="headerlink" title="Apple ecosystem transformation"></a>Apple ecosystem transformation</h2><p>Should the DOJ prevail, changes to the App Store, Apple’s services, and other “Super Apps,” as named in the complaint, could affect everything from developer profits to consumer spending habits.</p><p>Some possible changes include adjusting Apple’s device pricing, where the pressure to lower iPhone prices could lead to reduced profit margins to align more closely with industry standards. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-product-manuals-specs-repair-guides-documentation-webpage/" >You can now get Apple product manuals, specs, and repair guides all in one place <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The ruling could also affect how Apple bundles and sells digital content and services, potentially leading to more competitive pricing and options for consumers. Additionally, mandates to relax App Store rules could enable broader third-party developer participation and innovation. This could also require Apple to provide more equitable API access, enhancing third-party app functionality and competitiveness. </p><p>The changes could also lead to increased innovation and competition in markets such as financial services and gaming, which are heavily constrained by Apple’s current policies. Eliminating artificial barriers would foster a competitive environment for new entrants, and strategies to prevent customer lock-in would facilitate easier transitions to competitor products. </p><p>Adjustments to Apple’s revenue practices could ensure fairer conditions for developers, leading to a more open and flexible ecosystem. Overall, the changes have the potential to fundamentally alter the economics of the app market, leading to a more competitive and innovative industry.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZTlPdOFNmo?si=Ym8p7ayV1gtNzzXj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Open-standards-and-protocols-and-the-increase-of-open-source-software-on-Apple-platforms"><a href="#Open-standards-and-protocols-and-the-increase-of-open-source-software-on-Apple-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Open standards and protocols and the increase of open-source software on Apple platforms"></a>Open standards and protocols and the increase of open-source software on Apple platforms</h2><p>With a requirement for sideloading and allowing third-party app stores and a need for providing more open access to APIs, the call for open standards and increased use of open-source software on Apple platforms may also gain momentum. This shift toward openness will enhance interoperability across devices and challenge Apple’s long-standing paradigms of exclusivity and controlled ecosystems. </p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced messaging interoperability:</strong> Mandating support for universal messaging standards like RCS to improve communication between iOS and Android devices.</li><li><strong>Payment, wallet, and digital identity diversification:</strong> In addition to new open transaction and digital identity platforms like OpenWallet, we might see further diversification in the digital wallet and payment systems market, reducing Apple’s control over financial transactions with the predominance of Apple Pay on iOS devices, and potentially lowering transaction fees.</li><li><strong>Integration of open source applications:</strong> Easier installation and use of open source software on iOS devices, broadening the range of available tools and apps.</li><li><strong>Access to open-source app repositories:</strong> Users might be able to download apps from open-source repositories, offering a wider selection of apps and potentially fostering a community-driven app development ecosystem on Apple devices.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58KlTPHv8dU?si=7ICagyNgrao7OkVO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Regulatory-and-industry-wide-impact"><a href="#Regulatory-and-industry-wide-impact" class="headerlink" title="Regulatory and industry-wide impact"></a>Regulatory and industry-wide impact</h2><p>The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Apple could set a precedent that could significantly impact not just the company but also the entire tech industry. The regulatory impact of this lawsuit could lead to more stringent oversight, which could affect Apple’s operational flexibility and potentially reshape the digital market. A successful antitrust action against Apple could also set legal precedents for other tech giants, leading to a more globally consistent regulatory framework. </p><p>Apple, of course, is not giving up the fight. Its response to the DOJ lawsuit, issued on March 21, is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>“At Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love—designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people’s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users. This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”</p></blockquote><p>As Apple navigates these legal and market challenges, it must maintain its hallmark of a secure, user-friendly environment while potentially opening up access to more apps and services. This lawsuit’s implications are profound, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds and affects the tech industry in the coming years.</p><h3 id="Previous-coverage"><a href="#Previous-coverage" class="headerlink" title="Previous coverage"></a>Previous coverage</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-breaks-up-advertising-when-will-the-doj-and-the-eu-break-up-apple"><strong>Apple breaks up advertising.

Sonos, a major player in the multi-room audio market, recently updated its <a class="link"   href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/controller-app" >S2 controller app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iOS, iPadOS, and Android. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sonos/" >The best Sonos speakers: How the Sonos One, Arc, Beam, and more compare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The latest version of Sonos offers a more uniform and simplified user interface. Furthermore, Sonos has introduced a web-based user experience for Mac and Windows desktop platforms. This web-based interface is accessible through <a class="link"   href="https://www.sonos.com/web-app" >www.sonos.com/web-app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and also functions on ChromeOS and other desktop versions of Linux which use Chrome and Chromium-based browsers. This new web-based interface will replace the old desktop controller, as the company has stopped distributing the desktop version.</p><p>While this move towards a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/sonos-app-overhaul-will-deliver-customizable-home-screen-universal-search-and-more/" >more integrated software environment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is exciting, it does raise questions about the future of hardware upgrades and the lifespan of existing devices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Observations-of-the-new-S2-UX"><a href="#Observations-of-the-new-S2-UX" class="headerlink" title="Observations of the new S2 UX"></a>Observations of the new S2 UX</h2><p>The new Sonos S2 controller app for iPadOS.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The new user experience (UX) of Sonos’s iOS, Android, and iPadOS apps is consistent and visually appealing. The design is modern and streamlined, focusing on accessibility (which the company admits is a <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-and-music-services-228995/new-sonos-app-and-accessibility-6892068" >work in progress <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) and readability. The web version, which has replaced the desktop version, also follows this approach, indicating a strategic alignment in Sonos’ software development. </p><p>Although I did not extensively explore the web UX, I tested its functionality for finding and playing music in different rooms. The web UX appears to be designed to reflect the settings of the smartphone UX and, as such, is strictly a content player. Configuring and changing the settings of a Sonos system or its components now requires the smartphone app, as none of these tasks can be completed through the browser.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It is uncertain whether the codebase is entirely unified. The missing configuration options in the web user interface indicate that the smartphone versions may require extra local software components to execute that specific function.</p><p> What is evident is that for the web control to function, the Sonos device components now have significantly more cloud connectivity than they did before.</p><p>Nevertheless, the consistent visual appearance across all platforms significantly enhances the user experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZsnjxeSh1U?si=hZIfzQPDNX5KtOCg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-harmonious-advantages-of-Sonos’-web-based-platform"><a href="#The-harmonious-advantages-of-Sonos’-web-based-platform" class="headerlink" title="The harmonious: advantages of Sonos’ web-based platform"></a>The harmonious: advantages of Sonos’ web-based platform</h2><p>The new Sonos S2 web controller, as shown on a Mac.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The primary advantage of Sonos’ new software strategy lies in its apparent commitment to uniformity. By developing a single, cohesive web-based platform, Sonos ensures that all users, regardless of the device they use, experience the same interface and features. This consistency eliminates the fragmentation often seen in apps developed separately for different platforms and aligns perfectly with the contemporary consumer’s expectation for seamless integration.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-premium-chromebooks-ive-tested-is-cheaper-than-youd-think/" >One of the most premium Chromebooks I’ve tested is cheaper than you’d think <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The updated software sports a cleaner design and boasts enhanced functionality, such as improved search capabilities, making it easier for users to find their favorite music and podcasts. This focus on usability can significantly enhance user satisfaction and cement Sonos’s reputation as a user-centric brand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L603QXgjb3I?si=sMYHfMGy2kNPSHPt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-dissonant-the-challenge-of-hardware-compatibility-and-loss-of-functionality"><a href="#The-dissonant-the-challenge-of-hardware-compatibility-and-loss-of-functionality" class="headerlink" title="The dissonant: the challenge of hardware compatibility and loss of functionality"></a>The dissonant: the challenge of hardware compatibility and loss of functionality</h2><p>Moving to a web-based platform might not be without its challenges. This approach indicates a potential shift from prioritizing hardware to prioritizing software, which might result in slower hardware innovation or force older models to become obsolete if they cannot support newer software updates. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/these-speakers-deliver-impressively-accurate-sound-for-any-style-of-music/" >These speakers deliver impressively accurate sound for any style of music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>In the past, Sonos has faced criticism for transitioning between major software versions, such as the move from S1 to S2, which left some older devices unable to integrate with newer systems. This segmentation of the ecosystem can be frustrating for users who have invested heavily in their audio setups only to find them somewhat outdated due to software incompatibilities. </p><p>While the <a class="link"   href="https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/sonos-app-version-compatibility" >list of S2-compatible hardware has not changed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the controller and recent firmware updates to support it, the changeover to this now cloud-connected version raises a few eyebrows. </p><p>The web version of the application performs well overall. However, depending on network conditions, it communicates with the Sonos components through a cloud connection, and those components may respond slowly to certain commands, such as adjusting the volume or forwarding to the next track on a playlist. </p><p>Additionally, we have experienced a few Internal Server Errors (ISEs) on the web client. When this occurs, we had to restart the browser session (in our case, Safari) running the application, which may indicate initial cloud capacity issues as Sonos rolled out the new web UX. These issues have been observed since the initial publication of this article.</p><p>The biggest source of anguish from Sonos customers is that the new S2 update also appears to have (temporarily) removed the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/controllers-and-music-services-229131/new-app-ios-and-local-music-library-nas-6892405" >search local music libraries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (due to the removal of SMB1 and HTTPS library connectivity), as confirmed by support. <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/advanced-setups-229133/looks-like-we-may-lose-our-networked-libraries-with-next-big-update-nas-drive-6891981" >In a future update <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be re-established with SMB2 and cloud library support. There’s also a current inability to edit playlists and song queues in the new app, which is angering users.</p><p>The company is <a class="link"   href="https://en.community.sonos.com/events/sonos-app-redesign-ama-6" >hosting an AMA on May 14th <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to address customer concerns about these redesign issues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSKkJrJ57EA?si=WDOmInPE9EgQa_tB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-bigger-picture-software-over-hardware"><a href="#The-bigger-picture-software-over-hardware" class="headerlink" title="The bigger picture: software over hardware?"></a>The bigger picture: software over hardware?</h2><p>A view of the Sonos S2 controller on iPhone.</p><p>Screenshot by Jason Perlow&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The consumer electronics industry is shifting towards a software-dominated approach, where device functionality and durability depend more on software updates than hardware capabilities. This shift could redefine consumer expectations and force a reevaluation of what it means to “upgrade.” </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-over-ear-headphones/" >The best over-ear headphones: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Instead of buying new hardware, consumers might want to consider how long their current devices will remain compatible with new software releases. How consumers respond to these changes can significantly impact brand loyalty. </p><p>Companies like Sonos that balance innovation with support for legacy systems are likely to retain loyal customers. Being transparent about product lifecycles and offering programs to help customers upgrade older, incompatible devices could alleviate dissatisfaction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kr7Dpw0HuM?si=05wWDXdPgmC-oBBE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Looking-forward-the-role-of-innovation-in-user-experience"><a href="#Looking-forward-the-role-of-innovation-in-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="Looking forward: the role of innovation in user experience"></a>Looking forward: the role of innovation in user experience</h2><p>Sonos’ latest move toward a software-centric approach reflects a broader trend in the consumer electronics industry. While this shift has the potential to offer an enhanced user experience, companies need to be mindful of how it affects consumer trust and satisfaction. As Sonos navigates this new terrain, its success will depend on how well it integrates its software innovation with hardware compatibility.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/the-most-immersive-speaker-system-ive-ever-tested-is-not-from-bose-or-sonos/" >The most immersive speaker system I’ve ever tested is not from Bose or Sonos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Although Sonos’ new software platform simplifies audio control, it raises questions about the future of hardware upgrades and overall system compatibility. Sonos’ ability to manage these challenges will determine whether its software strategy resonates with consumers or falls short.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

MKV is the format that will contain all the video, audio, subtitle tracks, chapters, and menus of a DVD without quality loss. And MKV can provide better compatibility than some other formats like ISO image or DVD VIDEO_TS folder. But you may don’t want to transcode a DVD to MKV and lose some video quality. You may just want to extract the DVD video to MKV format, untouched. In this post, we will show you the right way to rip DVD to MKV without re-encoding.</p><h2 id="Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss"><a href="#Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss"></a>Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >WinX DVD Ripper Platinum <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - easily rip DVD to MKV, ISO image, MPG, and Video_TS folder in <strong>1:1 quality</strong>.

The most popular encryption techs include CSS encryption, Sony ARccOS encryption, RCE Region protection, Disney X-project DRM, region code etc. DVD rippers can bypass DVD copy protections and deliver a DRM-free file.

Usually, common DVD rippers can help rip a 4-8 GB DVD movie to a digital file in hundreds of MB, but you will get much quality loss.

id="How-did-we-choose-these-laptop-deals"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-laptop-deals" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these laptop deals?"></a>How did we choose these laptop deals?</h2><p>We searched for laptop deals at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, and also at the websites of leading manufacturers like Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, Acer, and Asus. We also used various price trackers to ensure that a claimed deal wasn’t spurious.</p><p>We have concentrated on quality products from leading vendors, as discounts on these laptops are likely to be most sought-after by potential buyers.</p><p>When compiling the list of the best deals, we considered the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: Naturally, the price point of our recommended laptops has to include a worthwhile discount. While some discounts are small in relation to an overall price tag - for example, $30 off a $150 device - and other discounts are in the hundreds of dollars, we wanted to ensure that in any case, it’s value for money.</li><li><strong>Features</strong>: We included a range of laptops with features sure to appeal to you, including different screen sizes, processors, memory options, and storage. Furthermore, these laptops include varying levels of security, parental lock options, and display resolutions.</li><li><strong>Use cases</strong>: At ZDNET, we also took into account different use cases. You might be in the market for a budget-friendly, basic laptop for a child, for example, or you may need a future-proof laptop suitable for work. Or, it might be a gaming device you’re after. So, we have compiled a set of recommendations based on different purposes.</li></ul><h2 id="What-specifications-do-I-need-to-look-for-in-a-laptop"><a href="#What-specifications-do-I-need-to-look-for-in-a-laptop" class="headerlink" title="What specifications do I need to look for in a laptop?"></a>What specifications do I need to look for in a laptop?</h2><p>The right specs depend on your needs and how you intend to use your new laptop – whether for gaming, studies, video calling, or simply daily internet surfing. We break it down for you below:</p><ul><li><strong>Processing power&#x2F;CPU:</strong> The processor is the computer’s brain and handles the basic programming tasks. Gamers will want a higher processor that can even boost to a higher GHz threshold for AAA games like Death Stranding and Halo Infinite. Higher processor outputs will also apply to content creators who need a laptop to handle editing video software, but if you’re using your laptop for general work or just surfing the internet, you can opt for a lower processor.</li><li><strong>Graphics card&#x2F;GPU:</strong> Again, gamers and content creators will want a higher graphics card to reflect the beautiful imagery for their gaming. I personally recommend that gamers opt for at least an RTX 3060 at the moment. However, again, internet surfers and workers shouldn’t worry too much about the graphics if you’re focusing on building out Word documents.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: For those that focus on lighter laptop use, 256GB of SSD storage will be plenty of space for your laptop. However, if you need more storage for high-resolution photos, videos, or more, you’ll want to opt for 512GB of storage or even 1TB.</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: In conjunction with the CPU, RAM is used to help the computer multi-task and is vital to running programs. ZDNET expert Adrian Kingsley-Hughes breaks down <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-much-ram-does-your-windows-10-pc-need/" >RAM needs here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but at minimum, especially for working, you should opt for around 8GB, and gamers will potentially want more.</li></ul><h2 id="Do-I-need-a-gaming-laptop-or-a-“regular”-laptop"><a href="#Do-I-need-a-gaming-laptop-or-a-“regular”-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Do I need a gaming laptop or a “regular” laptop?"></a>Do I need a gaming laptop or a “regular” laptop?</h2><p>Again, it depends on your needs. Those who <em>aren’t</em> gamers can opt for a regular laptop with high specs, but content creators or those who work with heavy editing software should opt for a designer’s laptop or a gaming laptop. Not because, of course, you want to have the best gaming specs on the side, but because those laptops come with powerful CPUs, GPUs, and high RAM to handle the heavy requirements that software needs.</p><h2 id="How-much-should-I-pay-for-a-good-laptop"><a href="#How-much-should-I-pay-for-a-good-laptop" class="headerlink" title="How much should I pay for a good laptop?"></a>How much should I pay for a good laptop?</h2><p>When you’re considering your budget for a new laptop, you have to consider what you want to use the device for. </p><p>If you’re a gamer who needs a high-spec laptop with a decent graphics card, top-of-the-range display and high refresh rate, you should expect to pay more than $500 - $600 – and potentially beyond $1,000. However, if you need a laptop for basic tasks, studying, and streaming, you can easily get away with a basic laptop for a few hundred dollars. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560"

It has been updated every year or so since then to reflect new tools and workflows.</em></p><p>Remember the old productivity and office suites we all used to use? I don’t know about you, but my mix of productivity tools has certainly changed over the years. What I use today is vastly different from my daily productivity “suite” of years past.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/office-365-vs-g-suite-which-productivity-suite-is-best-for-your-business/"><strong>Office 365 vs Google Workspace: Which productivity suite is best</strong></a></p><p>Before I take you through both the tools and my “process,” let me point out that this stuff is different for everyone. My work these days consists far more of educating and communicating, and far less time spent living in spreadsheets than back in the days when I ran startups. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaM818fFKXQ?si=ZZLA4lFSHSgCpSE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-to-do-list-app/" >The 6 best to-do list apps: Get organized What is the best to-do list app? Any.do! But ZDNet reviewed all the top picks to help you organize and liberate your life.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Today, I coordinate with teams, rather than manage them. I have students rather than employees. I research projects rather than launch products. My daily productivity flow reflects the changes in career as I’ve evolved from founder to advisor, manager to professor, and publisher to columnist. </p><p>I use a tremendous number of tools for my projects, and they often change from project to project. But what I’m going to discuss here are the tools I use on a daily basis to manage my “flow”. </p><h2 id="What-do-I-mean-by-my-flow"><a href="#What-do-I-mean-by-my-flow" class="headerlink" title="What do I mean by my flow?"></a>What do I mean by my flow?</h2><p>I divide my work day into two main chunks of time: Communications and knowledge gathering time, and project time. Every day has pretty much the same communications and knowledge gathering activities, which follows a relatively consistent pattern that has proven to be highly productive for me. These are the daily productivity activities I’ve been talking about. </p><p>In my case, morning to mid-afternoon is that daily productivity time. That’s when I connect with and follow-up with all my constituents, students, editors, producers, etc., when I do my daily reading to keep up with both news and new technology, and when I manage my schedule, schedule my tasks, make calls, and write and respond to email. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-a-smart-office-make-your-team-more-productive-too/"><strong>Can a smart office make your team more productive too?</strong></a></p><p>That whole process is my flow. Over my many various iterations, I’ve managed to optimize this process so I’m able to get a tremendous amount done in a relatively short amount of time.</p><p>The other half of my day is project time. This is when I work on everything from academic papers to the presentations, white papers, and webcasts I do for ZDNet to developing code to most of the projects I write about for DIY-IT. I tend to work on projects in the late afternoon and the late evening, with a break in the early evening for family time and lunch or dinner. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Q8Feep0Rc0?si=YkPhRxXGvrRRMJtb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Changes-due-to-the-pandemic"><a href="#Changes-due-to-the-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Changes due to the pandemic"></a>Changes due to the pandemic</h2><p>The last time I updated this guide was in early 2019. Obviously, a few things have happened since then. In terms of my daily productivity, I go out a lot less than I used to. Back then, I was often running from place to place and had to build up an everyday carry (EDC) that could allow me to dive into any project or work with any team no matter where I was. I had EDC kits for a coffee shop programming run and EDC kits for week long conference work. I even built an EDC for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/road-tech-how-i-left-florida-to-escape-irma-and-never-went-back/" >emergency evacuation of an indeterminate time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-inside-gewirtzs-home-office-20-years-of-refinement-and-evolution/"><strong>What’s inside Gewirtz’s home office? 20 years of refinement and evolution</strong></a></p><p>Now, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-inside-gewirtzs-home-office-20-years-of-refinement-and-evolution/" >mostly I’m home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If I’m out, it’s a dedicated out-and-back with a specific purpose. There is no meandering, browsing, or schmoozing. Yes, I know other people may feel comfortable going back to the pre-pandemic normal, but I have reasons for playing it a bit more safe than most might.</p><p>In any case, what that means is that instead of my escalating ranking of phones, tablets, Chromebooks and laptops, I just carry my <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dont-buy-that-expensive-new-iphone-13-how-used-iphones-can-deliver-huge-savings/" >iPhone 12 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It will keep me up to speed until I get back home and can pick up where I left off.</p><h2 id="Tools-for-my-daily-flow"><a href="#Tools-for-my-daily-flow" class="headerlink" title="Tools for my daily flow"></a>Tools for my daily flow</h2><p>Now that you understand how my working environment has changed and how I structure my work day, let’s discuss the tools I use in my daily flow. It all starts with Gmail… </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PD0vq5qAYkw?si=5H3KWtCfUOYg1Nlv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="First-morning-Gmail"><a href="#First-morning-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="First morning Gmail"></a>First morning Gmail</h2><p>It’s been quite a while since <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-bit-the-bullet-and-finally-switched-from-outlook-to-gmail/" >I made the switch from Outlook to Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and I have to tell you, my productivity has improved tremendously, and after more than half a decade of use, I don’t regret the move one bit. Having the exact same email interface on all my machines, with tight integration into my iPhone, iPad, and computers, has made all the difference. </p><p>I no longer have thousands of unruly items filling my inbox. In fact, that’s a big part of what this daily productivity process is all about. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/help-i-have-100000-unread-messages-in-my-gmail-inbox-where-do-i-even-start-ask-zdnet/"><strong>Help! I have 100,000 unread messages in my Gmail inbox. How do I get to Inbox Zero?</strong></a></p><p>My day starts with my alarm going off. From under the covers, I usually reach over to my phone, painfully crack one eye open, tap the Gmail app, and scan to see if there’s anything on fire. </p><p>Actually, scratch that. I no longer take my iPhone to bed with me. Instead, I wear my <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-fitness-and-how-to-use-it/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When I wake up, I can still glance at my notifications, but by leaving the tiny computers outside of the bedroom, I’m not tempted to check on work, read my mail, or play Wordle when I should be sleeping.</p><p>The boy</p><p>The way I have Gmail set up, only the most important messages show up on my watch. Same with Slack notifications. Basically, unless there’s something urgent from one of my editors, I can start my day in peace. If there’s nothing urgent, I hit the snooze button. After repeating this ritual two or three times, I get up, do my morning necessaries, and zombie-walk to the coffee maker. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LW6wNx3XAj8?si=VaIuFIIx8MM_RhUR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >The best smartwatches Apple, Samsung, and others battle for your wrist.

Eventually, I reach the couch, flip on my couch-side monitor, and once again check my email. </p><p>At this point, I tend to take note of what’s in my inbox, but I neither process it, nor respond to it. I want to let the coffee take hold. </p><p>I also take a quick look at my calendar and my to-do list to make sure I know what’s on deck for the day. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlwr9LjJ-ng?si=I6UNAtfBkY2FTceu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Daily-must-reads-with-Pocket"><a href="#Daily-must-reads-with-Pocket" class="headerlink" title="Daily must-reads with Pocket"></a>Daily must-reads with Pocket</h2><p>Next up, I hit my daily most-reads. Of course, this starts with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/"><em>ZDNet</em></a>, then usually <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/"><em>Drudge</em></a>and <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/"><em>Techmeme</em></a>. I do a quick headline scan and anything that seems worth reading, I right-click and save to <a class="link"   href="http://getpocket.com/" >Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Some of my reads for later today.</p><p>Before I used Pocket, I used to open all the interesting headlines as new tabs. My browser was often overwhelmed with browser tabs, sometimes to the point of crashing. If I switched computers, I had to try to figure out what tabs I had open, and otherwise somehow coordinate 10-50 open tabs. It was a mess. </p><p>Now, I just save everything into Pocket, for later review. I actually do this in two phases. I use <em>ZDNet</em>, <em>Drudge</em>, and <em>Techmeme</em> as a quick way to find out what the big news of the day is. Later in the morning, I’ll open up <a class="link"   href="http://feedly.com/" >Feedly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and tackle as many sites as I feel I have time for, from my big list of feeds. Or, I might dig into a story that’s interesting and trending, and look for more content, which I’ll also save into Pocket. </p><p>The nice part about this is I can easily do this while drinking coffee. I can get a feel for the day from the headlines, but I don’t need to have all my brain cells online quite so early. Then I go and make my oatmeal. I now eat oatmeal for breakfast every day. Why didn’t I do this when I was younger. It’s <em>so</em> good for you.</p><p>By this point, I’m somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes into my day, I’ve had one or two cups of coffee, and I have a pretty solid feel for both what’s going on in my own various domains as well as what’s going on in the rest of the world. It’s a very good, very quick way to come up to speed while waking up.</p><p>Depending on the importance and urgency of the messages in my Gmail inbox, I’ll either go straight into my morning email cycle or begin my morning reading. I prefer to do morning reading before email, so I’ll discuss that next. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHFtYJppXFk?si=ylFaAT4nXqCmlV8F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Pocket-read-post-archive-cycle"><a href="#The-Pocket-read-post-archive-cycle" class="headerlink" title="The Pocket-read-post-archive cycle"></a>The Pocket-read-post-archive cycle</h2><p>I read. A lot. I need to keep up to date on a tremendous amount of information, both breaking news related and deep technical or academic information. As a result, a good percentage of my morning is spent reading. I also watch a lot of YouTube videos. I’m almost always learning about new stuff, and many YouTube videos provide great introductions to both how those things work and what they do. Without YouTube, I never would have <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-building-the-next-generation-x-carve-cnc-build-log/" >gotten my CNC up and running <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and done <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-first-big-cnc-project-a-parts-organizer-rack/" >my first successful build <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Because I’ve already selected the articles from my top sources, I can open up Pocket and start reading. I like this a lot, because I now have all my content in one location. </p><p>What’s particularly nice about Pocket is that it runs on not only my couch-side web browser and on Chrome, but there are versions of Pocket for iOS and Android. As a result, I can read articles anywhere – even in the <em>necessarium</em> or when I’m out and about. </p><p>Part of my morning flow is posting to the social networks. Unfortunately, this has changed. It used to be that whenever I found an article that was interesting in my Pocket collection, I tapped the Share icon in Pocket and then selected <a class="link"   href="http://bufferapp.com/" >Buffer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Buffer then took the article, scheduled it, and posted it to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Two clicks and I used to be able shared something interesting.</p><p>But Facebook broke that. Facebook no longer allows tools like Buffer and <a class="link"   href="https://hootsuite.com/" >Hootsuite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to to post to personal Facebook pages. I’ve spent years building up my personal Facebook page following and don’t want to start a corporate page (or orphan all my followers), so when Facebook broke auto-posting, it hurt. Now, I hand post to Twitter and then do it again on Facebook. LinkedIn gets a lot less attention, and, frankly, I post less frequently. </p><h3 id="Featured-reviews"><a href="#Featured-reviews" class="headerlink" title="Featured reviews"></a>Featured reviews</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/" >One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-upgraded-to-the-iphone-16-plus-heres-why-its-the-model-most-people-should-buy/" >I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/" >This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/" >Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Another aspect of my morning reading that’s changed is I no longer save articles to Evernote. I used to save off articles that would serve me for either projects I’m working on or general research resources. While I use <a class="link"   href="http://evernote.com/" >Evernote <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to write articles, I no longer use Evernote as my hub of everything. Pocket handles archived articles just fine. And Notion (more on that later) handles notes.</p><p>Rinse, wash, repeat. </p><p>I’m relatively holistic about my morning reading process. I do it until I’m bored or hungry, or feel like switching gears and moving on to managing my email and schedule. </p><p>The key point to all of this is that ever since I moved to this Pocket-read-post-archive cycle for my daily reading, my productivity and flexibility has gone up tremendously. I’m getting more done, and the quality of the process is far more pleasant. I’m no longer tied to my desktop browser, because all of these tools work on all my devices. </p><h2 id="Connecting-and-scheduling"><a href="#Connecting-and-scheduling" class="headerlink" title="Connecting and scheduling"></a>Connecting and scheduling</h2><p>Assuming there’s nothing on fire that I’ve had to handle first thing, at some point during the morning, I’ll switch from reading to communicating. I’ll switch out of Pocket and into Gmail and work my way through my email. </p><p>Gmail does a great job of filtering out spam, but I’ll go through the Updates and Promotions tabs and delete or mark-as-spam anything that’s not necessary. This is usually a pretty fast cleanup. </p><p>Sometimes, there’s something in my Updates section that indicates there’s an action item. For example, if one of my websites has pushed out a security warning, depending on the severity I’ll either go right to work fixing the problem or sending the email to Todoist as a to-do item. </p><p>This is where the integration of <a class="link"   href="https://todoist.com/" >Todoist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Gmail is so nice. All I need to do is tap the Todoist icon, and I can turn the email message into a to-do item, complete with a link back to the original email message. Once I’ve scheduled it as a to-do item (either for that day or a later date), I can then archive the message and it’s out of my inbox. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-do-vs-google-tasks-the-best-list-manager-app-for-you/"><strong>Microsoft To Do vs Google Tasks: The best list manager app for you</strong></a></p><p>I use the same process for the rest of my email. If I can reply immediately to a query from someone mailing me, I do. If not (for example, if it will require additional research or it’s really an action item disguised as an email message), I’ll send it over to Todoist as a to-do item and clear it out of my inbox. </p><p>I do the same with calendar-related items. For example, I’m on the Information Systems and Management Certificate Advisory Board at the UC Berkeley extension, and when I get an email that there’s a scheduled meeting, I can right-click on the date right in the middle of the email message and schedule it to the calendar. Once again, the original email is available as a link, so I can remove it from my inbox and archive it. </p><p>In this way, I can power through my inbox, responding, assigning to to-do items, or to calendar. Within a very short time, I have my inbox cleared. </p><p>Now, to be fair, I have a slight email fetish, so I do check back in to my inbox, once or twice (or 20 or 30 times) a day. But now that my inbox is generally clean and empty, that practice doesn’t have much to grab onto, and it’s only a waste of a second or two. </p><p>In fact, now that I have email notifications integrated into my watch, I’m finding I’m actually breaking myself of the habit, because unless I hear the notification tone, I don’t have any important emails coming in. I have actually gone a few hours without checking my email inbox, which is something of a record for me. </p><h2 id="Managing-my-daily-teaching-opportunities"><a href="#Managing-my-daily-teaching-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Managing my daily teaching opportunities"></a>Managing my daily teaching opportunities</h2><p>As it turns out, supporting users is a lot like teaching online students.</p><p>Some years ago, I adopted a bunch of WordPress plugins as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-code-how-to-think-about-side-projects/" >a side-project that helps me keep my coding skills sharp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the (unexpected) side-effects of that is that I now have users to support. Yep, even free plugins require some amount of support time.</p><p>The way I manage this is I’ve added a support ticketing system to my lab notes website. I use a cloud service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.helpscout.com/" >Help Scout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Users post their questions and I get an email notification. All the details for each users’ situation is kept in one thread on the site, so when I go back to the conversation days or weeks later, I can see what previously transpired, all in one place. </p><p>Help Scout also has great team features, but I’m a programming army of one.</p><p>I just think of those users like more of my students. If any questions show up in my inbox, I go into the ticketing system and answer questions. I’m not assigning users letter grades, but otherwise the process is pretty much the same. </p><p>By the way, this is also a great way to think about users, which I initially was a bit unhappy about adding to my daily workload. But the reframe is this: I’m an educator and these are more people in need of assistance while they’re learning to use these plugins. So, rather than thinking about providing user support as an added workload, I think of the users as more of my students and their questions as simply more teaching opportunities. It’s also a great way to keep up on what people are doing out there, and gives me a much more “on the street” dialog with users, which is invaluable as a tech journalist.</p><h3 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/" >We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/" >20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/" >My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/" >Want a programming job?

The go into <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/notion-app-review/" >the bug tracking system I manage in Notion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="To-doing-my-to-do-list"><a href="#To-doing-my-to-do-list" class="headerlink" title="To-doing my to-do list"></a>To-doing my to-do list</h2><p>By this point, I’m usually most of the way through the morning. My email has been processed and actions have been moved to my to-do list and schedule items to my calendar. I’ve done a considerable amount of reading, and I’m up to speed on the various issues I’m responsible for following. I’ve graded students and supported users (and added any bugs or key follow-up items to my to-do list). </p><p>Now, it’s time to tackle the to-do items. Like Pocket and Gmail, Todoist runs on my phone, my tablets, and on my desktop in a browser window. It even runs on my Apple Watch. So I can organize and manage my to-do items from anywhere. </p><p>The very first thing I do is go down the list and move items around. Some items are no longer a today priority, while some have increased in priority. I have some repeating tasks (like grading students for each of my sections) that pop up when they need to. </p><p>Before I go on to the rest of my day, which is doing my to-do tasks and slowly migrating into project time, I’ll tell you my newest secret weapon for managing to-do items: <a class="link"   href="https://notion.so/" >Notion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I used to use <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do this, but hit a couple of walls. Notion, which is a bit new and a bit weird, has a whole pile of possibilities. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/notion-app-review/"><strong>Notion app review: Why (and how) I rely on this powerful productivity tool</strong></a></p><p>Notion solves a classic to-do list problem: Too many items on the to-do lists. We all suffer from this practice, where anything that might have to be done, even someday items and “I’ll get to it when I can” items, future project ideas, and all the rest all wind up on the to-do list as low-priority items that fill the list to the brim. </p><p>Some days are spent merely taking all those items that were previously scheduled for the, say, 15th of next month, and moving them to the following month once again. </p><p>I gave this problem a lot of thought and realized there are items I need to do, that are actionable in the near term, and items that just need to be on a list somewhere, that have no specific priority. </p><p>Managing projects in Notion</p><p>Notion is a combination whiteboard, list manager, project manager, app engine, and database. It’s actually quite odd and quite wonderful. It takes a while to get your arms around all it can do, but once you do, it’s incredibly helpful. Unfortunately, it’s got a silly name, a relatively uninspiring icon and marketing site, so I worry about its survivability. That said, it does have some serious funding behind it, so I’m hoping for the best.</p><p>You can create boards of certain categories, and inside those boards, you can make lists. Each list item is a card on a board, and you can write notes and interact with other members of a team on the back of each card. It sounds complex, but it’s amazingly intuitive. </p><p>Notion is also available on Android and iOS as well as web platforms, so once again, I can work on my work from anywhere. </p><p>I’ve set up a bunch of Notion pages and all the items that “should be on the list” but aren’t actionable this week or next go onto a Notion. I regularly dig into those pages, particularly when I’m working on a corresponding project, and pull items from the page and assign them to Todoist – but only if I intend to work on them right away, that week. </p><p>That, by the way, is the entire key to keeping your to-do list under control. If you actually intend to do an item within a reasonably short period of time, put it on your to-do list. If you expect to do it someday, it’s not a to-do list item, not an actionable item, and you should write them on another list somewhere. I use Trello for that. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-3d-printer/" >The best 3D printers If you’re in the market for a 3D printer, you’ll find one here that fits your needs.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>I’ve also set up Notion pages for each 3D printer, and for managing and tracking my reviews and video projects. It’s great as a catch-all for lots of details, but unlike previous catch-alls like Evernote, Notion allows you to assign some structure and layout to the stuff you’re working with. </p><h2 id="Blocking-out-time-for-my-projects"><a href="#Blocking-out-time-for-my-projects" class="headerlink" title="Blocking out time for my projects"></a>Blocking out time for my projects</h2><p>I use Notion for managing the details of my projects, but I visualize them using Google Calendar. I have three special calendars I set up: DG Planner, Planner Tentative, and Project Due.</p><p>I turned off my regular appointments so you can see how I block out chunks of time. This is a busy month.</p><p>I start with Project Due. Each deadline is placed on the calendar in a full-day appointment. Those deadlines are displayed in red, so I can’t miss them. These calendar items represent the day I need to turn in a deliverable of one kind or another.</p><p>Next is DG Planner. I use this to block out a set of days for everything that has a Project Due entry. If a project will take me four days, I use four full-day appointments. If three days, I use three, and so on. This way, I can see how busy I’ll get, and I can make sure I don’t double or triple-book any of my busiest production times.</p><p>Finally, there’s Planner Tentative. This is where I block out the approximate time a project I may or may not be working on will probably take. That way, if I’m taking with my team about a bunch of projects, I can block out some tentative time and see how my month is shaping up.</p><p>With this system, I rarely lose track of projects and also rarely overbook myself. It’s worked quite well for a bunch of years now.</p><h2 id="Rethinking-your-flow"><a href="#Rethinking-your-flow" class="headerlink" title="Rethinking your flow"></a>Rethinking your flow</h2><p>Every few years, I rethink my productivity flow, usually when I find myself getting too far behind, or getting that <em>baaaad</em> feeling that I’m letting things slip through the cracks. This latest optimization, where I added Notion, has been working for a few months now, and so far it’s the most effective flow I’ve used. Most of the elements, particularly how I use Gmail and Pocket, have been productive processes for years. </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, your flow will be different, but I strongly recommend you think about your work processes and optimize your daily activities. You’ll find you’re more effective and also that your days are more pleasant. </p><p>That’s pretty much a nice win-win, isn’t it? </p><p>P.S. Surprisingly enough, there’s no Microsoft software in my daily tools, still. Used to be, I lived in Outlook. I still use PowerPoint heavily for presentations, but my daily productivity is now completely non-Microsoft. That wasn’t a political decision or statement. I rather like Microsoft. I just looked for and found the best tools for doing my job. If I were at Microsoft, I’d think long and hard about that. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Here’s How to Correctly Restore It</h2><p> Any Windows program that requires an internet connection will most likely use the dynamic link library, wininet.dll. This DLL accesses network information for various connectivity protocols, such as HTTP. When wininet.dll triggers a missing or not found error, your application may not communicate with the network (or internet) properly.</p><p> See below for some troubleshooting steps you can take to fix wininet.dll not found or missing errors.  </p><p> The wininet.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft’s operating systems, including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235" >Windows 8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265" >Windows 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311" >Windows Vista <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354" >Windows XP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Windows 2000.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pBaTXyMUlR0Xc_FLaxxY3GLac2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/wininet-dll-error-message-ee04bf78a2434e4ba0d84b6aa7589f54.png"                      alt="wininet dll error message"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Fix-Wininet-dll-Not-Found-or-Missing-Errors"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Wininet-dll-Not-Found-or-Missing-Errors" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Wininet.dll Not Found or Missing Errors"></a>How to Fix Wininet.dll Not Found or Missing Errors</h2><p> Do not download wininet.dll from a “DLL download” website. There are many<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455" >reasons why downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you need a copy of this file, it’s best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480" >Start Windows in Safe Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to complete any of the following steps if you’re unable to access Windows normally due to the error.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515" >Restore wininet.dll from the Recycle Bin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The easiest possible cause of a “missing” file is that you’ve mistakenly deleted it.<br> If you suspect this, but you’ve already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover wininet.dll with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893" >free file recovery program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> Completing this step is a smart idea only if you’re confident you’ve deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526" >Run a virus&#x2F;malware scan of your entire system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Some wininet.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It’s even possible that the error you’re seeing is related to a hostile program that’s masquerading as the file.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131" >Use System Restore to undo recent system changes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

If, for example, you’re receiving a “The file wininet.dll is missing” error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796" >drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >video card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .<br> The wininet.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example.

The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3hS27nZVi9Y?si=_Zqj_l4a4XkPqT2S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

Is It Possible to Burn a DVD with 720p&#x2F;1080p HD Video?</h2><p> You put into a 720p video and then output a complete DVD disc, which plays normally. And you think you are holding a 1280x720 resolution DVD. Well, actually you omit an important link. </p><p>The truth is that DVD authoring software always automatically converts video to standard DVD resolution for burning. So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos. The highest DVD resolution is 720x480 or 720x576.</p><h3 id="How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?"></a>How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?</h3><p>Here we will give you an example of how to burn a DVD with video in 720p resolution.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance. If you’re up close, you will see there is more black space between the pixels and the image seems to be a little bit fuzzy than before. </p><h4 id="Continue-Reading…"><a href="#Continue-Reading…" class="headerlink" title="Continue Reading…"></a>Continue Reading…</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >DVD vs Blu-ray vs Digital File: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >How to Free Rip DVD with Same Quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU08CQVsZz0?si=V-SvPfzRsQysMS0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Best Settings to Rip DVDs Fast with Good Quality &amp; Small Size <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dOmuXhsV6Y?si=aT6vgPbDx4ajjvdr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Streaming vs DVD?

MKV is the format that will contain all the video, audio, subtitle tracks, chapters, and menus of a DVD without quality loss. And MKV can provide better compatibility than some other formats like ISO image or DVD VIDEO_TS folder. But you may don’t want to transcode a DVD to MKV and lose some video quality. You may just want to extract the DVD video to MKV format, untouched. In this post, we will show you the right way to rip DVD to MKV without re-encoding.</p><h2 id="Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss"><a href="#Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss"></a>Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >WinX DVD Ripper Platinum <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - easily rip DVD to MKV, ISO image, MPG, and Video_TS folder in <strong>1:1 quality</strong>.
