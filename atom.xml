Ripping DVD will Remove DVD Copy Protections</strong> </p><p>Similar to Blu-ray, DVD disc is also equipped with a variety of protections to prevent DVD content from illegal use. The most popular encryption techs include CSS encryption, Sony ARccOS encryption, RCE Region protection, Disney X-project DRM, region code etc. DVD rippers can bypass DVD copy protections and deliver a DRM-free file.

Besides standard DVD resolution, some people also wonder what the HD DVD resolution is. </p><ul><li>HD DVD resolution: 1280 x 720 (720p), 1920 x 1080 (1080i&#x2F;1080p)</li></ul><p> So apparently, SD DVDs are not in 1080p or 720p.

The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASUEYpqSP5E?si=0KOZxrTVexTuUkRn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

How to Make Standard DVDs Look Better on an HDTV?</h2><p><em>“I’m thinking of buying an HD TV, but I’m concerned about what my SD DVDs will look on it. I took a beautiful SD DVD of _The Asphalt Jungle_ with me to Best Buy, and they played it in an “upconverting” DVD player on both a 720p and a 1080p screen; it looked terrible on both, much worse than on my picture-tube TV. How to make it better? “</em></p><p>The visual effect is determined by various factors, such as DVD resolution, your display resolution, the display size and the distance between you and the TV. A 480p DVD is crystal enough on mobile phones. However, on 1080P widescreen HDTV, it’s barely clear. The image will be stretched based on the size of the TV and that will pixelate the image.</p><p>How to make DVDs look better on widescreen?

Is It Possible to Burn a DVD with 720p&#x2F;1080p HD Video?</h2><p> You put into a 720p video and then output a complete DVD disc, which plays normally. And you think you are holding a 1280x720 resolution DVD. Well, actually you omit an important link. </p><p>The truth is that DVD authoring software always automatically converts video to standard DVD resolution for burning. So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos. The highest DVD resolution is 720x480 or 720x576.</p><h3 id="How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?"></a>How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?</h3><p>Here we will give you an example of how to burn a DVD with video in 720p resolution.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance. If you’re up close, you will see there is more black space between the pixels and the image seems to be a little bit fuzzy than before. </p><h4 id="Continue-Reading…"><a href="#Continue-Reading…" class="headerlink" title="Continue Reading…"></a>Continue Reading…</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >DVD vs Blu-ray vs Digital File: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >How to Free Rip DVD with Same Quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Best Settings to Rip DVDs Fast with Good Quality &amp; Small Size <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Streaming vs DVD?

How do DVDs look on 4K screen? </p><p>In this article, we delve into the world of DVD resolutions to uncover its intricacies and limitations. From the basics of DVD SD resolutions to how to make DVD quality better, we’ll explore why DVDs still matter in today’s digital landscape.</p><h2 id="Q1-What-is-the-Resolution-of-DVDs"><a href="#Q1-What-is-the-Resolution-of-DVDs" class="headerlink" title="Q1.

Besides standard DVD resolution, some people also wonder what the HD DVD resolution is. </p><ul><li>HD DVD resolution: 1280 x 720 (720p), 1920 x 1080 (1080i&#x2F;1080p)</li></ul><p> So apparently, SD DVDs are not in 1080p or 720p.

The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSfA74aeYeA?si=HdJSMdeS7HVtS6-j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

A 480p DVD is crystal enough on mobile phones. However, on 1080P widescreen HDTV, it’s barely clear.

Is It Possible to Burn a DVD with 720p&#x2F;1080p HD Video?</h2><p> You put into a 720p video and then output a complete DVD disc, which plays normally. And you think you are holding a 1280x720 resolution DVD. Well, actually you omit an important link. </p><p>The truth is that DVD authoring software always automatically converts video to standard DVD resolution for burning. So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos. The highest DVD resolution is 720x480 or 720x576.</p><h3 id="How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?"></a>How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?</h3><p>Here we will give you an example of how to burn a DVD with video in 720p resolution.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance. If you’re up close, you will see there is more black space between the pixels and the image seems to be a little bit fuzzy than before. </p><h4 id="Continue-Reading…"><a href="#Continue-Reading…" class="headerlink" title="Continue Reading…"></a>Continue Reading…</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >DVD vs Blu-ray vs Digital File: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >How to Free Rip DVD with Same Quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Best Settings to Rip DVDs Fast with Good Quality &amp; Small Size <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Streaming vs DVD?

With the new OS version, you can directly customize, move, and rearrange the sections and icons in Control Center, letting you set up multiple screens that are easily accessible with just a swipe. Adding a new control is also simpler and more intuitive. Here’s how this works.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-ios-18-features-ive-been-using-on-android-for-a-while/" >5 iOS 18 features I’ve been using on Android for a while <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>With previous versions of iOS, you’d have to head to Settings to customize Control Center, choosing which controls to add or remove. With iOS 18, you can tweak and manage the icons directly in Control Center itself. This means you can visually add, remove, and otherwise organize the different controls.</p><p>If you want to follow along, you’ll need to install the iOS 18 public beta on an iPhone. Though the public beta should be more stable than the earlier developer beta, you may want to set this up on a spare iPhone if one is available.

Instead of viewing a phone for your child as a negative thing, you can gain peace of mind with the ability to track their location and contact them directly no matter where they are, or who they are with. And while the decision to get your kid a phone can be complicated, we’ve broken it down for you.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-kids-tablet/"><strong>The best kids’ tablets</strong></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-best-kids’-phone-right-now"><a href="#What-is-the-best-kids’-phone-right-now" class="headerlink" title="What is the best kids’ phone right now?"></a>What is the best kids’ phone right now?</h2><p>While there are some phones on the market made specifically for kids, other smartphones provide basic and affordable features that could be useful to your child.

The most inexpensive iPhone is the iPhone SE, which starts at $429. Apple revamped the iPhone SE in 2022 with the same processor as the more expensive iPhone 13 lineup. I went hands-on with the iPhone SE, and the end result was an iPhone 13-like experience in a phone that’s half the price. </p><p>The phone features a 4.7-inch display and a Touch ID home button that your child can use to secure their iPhone with a fingerprint. The rear camera takes photos that are nearly as clear and crisp as higher-end iPhones, while the front camera provides a solid FaceTime experience. </p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-iphone-se-2022-review/"><strong>Apple iPhone SE: You simply can’t find a better phone at this price</strong></a></p><p>In addition to excellent hardware at a reasonable price, you’re also getting access to Screen Time parental controls, Find My, Family Sharing, and the rest of Apple’s software services.

Not only have I tested these devices myself, but I’ve experienced my own kids reaching the age of needing their first phone. All five of these picks are something I would (and have) trust(ed) my kids to take care of. </p><p>ZDNET does extensive hands-on testing of phones, including ease of use, and paying attention to specs like display, battery life, and overall experience while using the phone. For products we recommend, we write a product spotlight review that we update periodically with new features and pricing information.</p><p>For the phones we have not gone hands-on with, we do extensive research into different products and brands, taking into consideration user reviews (both good and bad), competitor analysis, and more. </p><h2 id="What-about-parental-controls-for-a-kids-phone"><a href="#What-about-parental-controls-for-a-kids-phone" class="headerlink" title="What about parental controls for a kids phone?"></a>What about parental controls for a kids phone?</h2><p>Both Apple and Google have their own respective solutions for adding parental controls to an iPhone or Android phone.

However, if you want to buy a phone outright without getting locked into device payments, you can always start with a prepaid carrier like Republic Wireless or Visible. The plans are cheap, and you’re not committed to paying the carrier back for a phone if your child loses it. </p><p>If you opt to add a line to your account, most carriers allow you to mix and match plans. For example, you can have your number on a plan that allows unlimited data usage at full speed, and then give your child a plan that forfeits data speed when the network is busy. It saves you money while still giving your child access to everything they need a phone to do. </p><h2 id="Are-there-apps-built-in-to-keep-track-of-my-kid’s-location"><a href="#Are-there-apps-built-in-to-keep-track-of-my-kid’s-location" class="headerlink" title="Are there apps built in to keep track of my kid’s location?"></a>Are there apps built in to keep track of my kid’s location?</h2><p>Yes!

You can get it in midnight, space gray, starlight or silver. The base configuration comes with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. </p><p>The 2023 15-inch model promises enhances graphics, a bigger viewing experience, and six speakers as opposed to four. </p><p>The M1 MacBook Air still holds it down with a 13.3-inch display and the tried and true MacBook Air design. Internally, you’ll get 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage.</p><p>The MacBook Air continues to be the perfect Mac for someone who doesn’t do much more than web browsing, school or enterprise work in Office apps, and&#x2F;or occasional video or photo editing.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6587225&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6587225.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2WQ3XX3/ref=asc_df_B0C2WQ3XX31726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0C2WQ3XX3&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C27a585ee-b24b-4de1-9efb-504c5906de2c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Ample options</li><li>The M1 MacBook Pro is impressively fast</li><li>The new M2 Pro and M2 Max are even faster</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Ample options can make buying challenging</li><li>Higher end MacBook Pros are expensive</li><li>The 13-inch model doesn’t really make sense in the lineup</li></ul><h2 id="MacBook-Pro"><a href="#MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="MacBook Pro"></a>MacBook Pro</h2><h3 id="Best-Mac-for-creatives"><a href="#Best-Mac-for-creatives" class="headerlink" title="Best Mac for creatives"></a>Best Mac for creatives</h3><p><strong>MacBook Pro specs:</strong> <strong>Display:</strong> 13.3 inches, 14.2 inches or 16.2 inches | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1, M2 Pro or M2 Max | <strong>Memory:</strong> Configurable from 8GB up to 96GB | <strong>GPU:</strong> Apple Silicon, ranging from 10 cores to 38 cores | <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB up to 8TB</p><p>Apple sells three different models of the MacBook Pro, all of which are powered by some form of Apple Silicon processor. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is powered by the base M2 processor, while you can configure the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with either the M2 Pro or M2 Max. The days of an Intel-powered MacBook Pro are long gone.</p><p>The base 13-inch model sticks to a design that includes a TouchBar but lacks an HDMI port or an SD Card reader. The bigger MacBook Pros, however, ditched the TouchBar in favor of dedicated function keys and a Touch ID sensor. The larger MacBook Pro models also have an HDMI 2.0 port and an SD Card reader, and MagSafe charging has made a comeback. </p><p>The larger Pro models also get speaker and display bumps, with some of the best onboard sound systems on laptops and new 120Hz ProMotion panels for smoother visuals.</p><p>Apple promises about a 20% performance boost in the M2 Pro and M2 Max over last year’s M1 Pro&#x2F;Max Macbook Pros – which, according to ZDNET’s testing, rings true. </p><p>The MacBook Pro line has always filled the role of a portable laptop that provides extra power and, now, extended battery life. If you’re in need of a laptop that will allow you to edit videos and photos or dive into CAD programs on the go, then the MacBook Pro is for you.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-pro-m2-max-review/"><strong>Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Max 2023): A content creator’s dream machine</strong></a></p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fully customizable</li><li>Powerful performance</li><li>Remodeled with an M2 Ultra processor</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Very pricey</li><li>Very few applications can actually push the Mac Pro to its limits</li><li>You still need to pay for wheels</li></ul><h2 id="Mac-Pro"><a href="#Mac-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Mac Pro"></a>Mac Pro</h2><h3 id="Best-Mac-for-computing-power"><a href="#Best-Mac-for-computing-power" class="headerlink" title="Best Mac for computing power"></a>Best Mac for computing power</h3><p><strong>Mac Pro specs: Display: N&#x2F;A</strong> | <strong>Processor:</strong> M2 Ultra | <strong>Memory:</strong> 192GB | <strong>GPU:</strong> 76-core | <strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB SSD | <strong>Ports:</strong> 8 Thunderbolt 4, 2 HDMI, Dual 10Gb Ethernet | <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-FI 6E; Bluetooth 5.3 </p><p>Announced at WWDC 2023, the new Mac Pro houses the powerful M2 Ultra chip and is said to support video transcoding and 3D simulation at a rate three times faster than its predecessor. It’s also Apple’s most powerful computer to date, besting what the Mac Studio and highest-end MacBook Pros are capable of.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-the-mac-news-from-wwdc-2023-mac-pro-mac-studio-and-m2-ultra/"><strong>All the Mac news from WWDC 2203</strong></a></p><p>Additionally, the Pro has eight Thunderbolt ports, two HDMI ports, and a 23-core Neural Engine capable of 31.6 trillion operations per second. The model starts at a steep $6,999. </p><p>For all that power, and that astronomical price, the Mac Pro’s audience is the most niche of the niche; You’ll need to be involved in big-budget movie production, graphic-intensive animations, and other power-hungry workflows to take advantage of the Mac Pro. Otherwise, you’re better off with one of Apple’s other M2-equipped systems.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHFS6XX/ref=asc_df_B0BSHFS6XX1726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0BSHFS6XX&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C27a585ee-b24b-4de1-9efb-504c5906de2c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746367-REG/apple%5Fmnh73ll%5Fa%5Fmac%5Fmini%5Fwith%5Fm2.html/BI/23252/KBID/28790/SID/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp" >View now at B&amp;H Photo-Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/376373/633495/10014?prodsku=6200726&u=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252F-%252F6200726.p%253Fcmp%253DRMX&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Impressive performance in a compact desktop</li><li>Most affordable Mac</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>You only get a power cable (no keyboard, mouse, or display)</li></ul><h2 id="Mac-Mini"><a href="#Mac-Mini" class="headerlink" title="Mac Mini"></a>Mac Mini</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_O8m9KphYzs?si=jITthzeyX_Kmt9X2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-compact-Mac"><a href="#Best-compact-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Best compact Mac"></a>Best compact Mac</h3><p><strong>Mac Mini specs: Display:</strong> N&#x2F;A | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M2 or M2 Pro | <strong>Memory:</strong> Configurable from 8GB up to 32GB | <strong>GPU:</strong> 10 to 16-core | <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB up to 8TB | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 7.75x7.75x1.41 inches </p><p>The Mac Mini has gone Intel-free, using only Apple’s M2 or M2 Pro processor. It’s the first time the Mini lineup hasn’t had an Intel offering.</p><p>The Mac Mini comes as the M2 model with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage, or you can choose the high-end base configuration for the M2 Pro processor, 16GB of memory and 512GB of storage. </p><p>Remember, with any of Apple’s M-series chips, you can’t upgrade the RAM or storage on your own. What you select at the time of purchase is what you’re stuck with. Granted, you can add external storage. </p><p>The Mac Mini is a strong desktop option if you don’t need anything portable, and now it’s more affordable than it’s ever been. And with the recent upgrade to the M2 chips in the Mini, you’re gaining a lot of performance. </p><p>The only major downside of the Mac Mini is the need to supply your own display, keyboard, and mouse.</p><p><strong>Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-mac-mini-2023-review/"><strong>Mac Mini</strong></a></p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/?&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>It’s a workhorse</li><li>SD card slot on the front of the housing</li><li>Thunderbolt 4 ports for days</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Performances comes with a cost</li><li>You only get a power cable (no keyboard, display, or mouse included)</li></ul><h2 id="Mac-Studio"><a href="#Mac-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Mac Studio"></a>Mac Studio</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SyMZxS9479s?si=0T6zZpyN2LBftFTM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-Mac-for-creators"><a href="#Best-Mac-for-creators" class="headerlink" title="Best Mac for creators"></a>Best Mac for creators</h3><p><strong>Mac Studio specs: Display:</strong> N&#x2F;A | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2 Max or M2 ultra | <strong>Memory:</strong> 32GB- 192GB | <strong>GPU:</strong> 24-core or 76-core | <strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB, 1TB, or800 GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth</p><p>Apple’s Mac Studio looks essentially like an elongated Mac Mini. The added height is for the cooling system Apple has engineered to keep the internals cool. Speaking of internals, you can choose between putting Apple’s M1 Max processor, the M1 Ultra processor, or even its newest additions – the M2 Max and all-powerful M2 ultra– inside the Mac Studio.</p><p>The base model Mac Studio has an M1 Max processor with a 10-core CPU, a 24-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, 32GB of memory, and 512GB of storage. When you upgrade you can get the Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra processor that has a 20-core CPU, a 48-core GPU, a 32-core Neural Engine, 64GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. And the most recent addition (second generation Mac Studio) announced at WWDC, has an M2 Max or M2 Ultra processor with a 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU, and up to 800GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth. </p><p>If you need plenty of performance and price isn’t a factor the Mac Studio (original) is exactly what you want. Heck, even the base Mac Studio build is more than enough power for nearly every user I know. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-the-mac-news-from-wwdc-2023-mac-pro-mac-studio-and-m2-ultra/"><strong>Comparing the best Macs: Is a MacBook or Mac Studio right for you?</strong></a> </p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0979LYGMS/ref=asc_df_B0979LYGMS1726743600000?creative=395261&creativeASIN=B0979LYGMS&linkCode=asn&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C27a585ee-b24b-4de1-9efb-504c5906de2c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Pros </p><ul><li>Fun color choices</li><li>A larger display for better functionality</li></ul><p>Cons </p><ul><li>Display limited to 24.5 inches max</li><li>No way to expand memory beyond 16GB</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="iMac"><a href="#iMac" class="headerlink" title="iMac"></a>iMac</h2><h3 id="Best-all-in-one-Mac"><a href="#Best-all-in-one-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Best all-in-one Mac"></a>Best all-in-one Mac</h3><p><strong>iMac specs: Display:</strong> 24.5t inches | <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple Silicon M1 | <strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB or 16GB | <strong>GPU:</strong> 7-core or 8-core Apple Silicon GPU | <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB up to 2TB</p><p>You no longer have two size options when it comes to iMac. After announced the new Mac Studio and accompanying Studio Display, the 27-inch iMac was removed from the Mac lineup. That means you’re left with the 24-inch iMac as your lone option, but hey, it comes in some really cool colors. </p><p>The 24-inch iMac has an M1 processor with a 7-core or 8-core GPU configuration. Reviews of the 24-inch iMac have been on par with other M1 Macs. It has plenty of power and is capable for everyday computing and then some. Keep in mind you can connect an extra monitor to the iMac to add more screen space. </p><p>Apple has developed color-matching keyboards for the new iMac, which have built-in Touch ID sensors. Meaning, you can log into your Mac on the included keyboard using your fingerprint.

But we’re also familiar with the specs and hardware powering each model and are aware of how old they are, whether an update is incoming, and just know in general which ones are worth buying. We pass that information along to you. </p><p>There are several factors to keep in mind when choosing the best Mac for you. These are some of the ones we considered that can also help you in your search.</p><ul><li><strong>Type:</strong> From laptops to desktops, Apple Macs are available in all different shapes and sizes. Before you begin shopping, consider whether you will be best suited by a laptop or a desktop. While a desktop is perfect for the office, a laptop can be a better choice when you prioritize portability.</li><li><strong>Generation:</strong> Each Apple laptop is subject to new updates every so often, with each version being referred to as a generation. Newer generations feature the latest and greatest technology, but there will come at a higher price. If you do not care about the newest features, an older-generation Mac could be a more affordable option for you.</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Another important consideration is the number of ports that a Mac can offer. Think about the number of devices that you will want to connect to your computer, and double-check the Mac specs to ensure that you will have all the connectivity you need.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Speaking of price, the cost of Macs can vary significantly, depending on the type of computer you need. In our search, we found that the best Macs range from about $800 to $7,000 based on the model and version that you choose.</li></ul><h2 id="Which-Mac-is-best-for-photography"><a href="#Which-Mac-is-best-for-photography" class="headerlink" title="Which Mac is best for photography?"></a>Which Mac is best for photography?</h2><p>The original (13-inch) M1 MacBook was solid, but with a maximum 16GB of RAM, it could never be an effective image-editing machine. However, with the latest 2023 MacBook Pro, Apple has corrected that mistake. It has the M2 Pro&#x2F;Max chip and up to 96GB RAM. It also comes with a 16-inch screen size, which is better than a 13-inch panel for viewing edits.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Mac-for-students"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Mac-for-students" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Mac for students?"></a>What is the best Mac for students?</h2><p>The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models offer a huge number of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-college-laptop/" >features for students <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Macs are made out of aluminum, which is an expensive material. Macs also boast some of the best security out of any computer and are less susceptible to malware and virus assaults. You’re also paying for the Apple brand name, not to mention the company’s high-end hardware. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNrOsjUdRz0?si=xGzhmNmtgxNTsRxN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-antivirus-software-for-Mac"><a href="#What-is-the-best-antivirus-software-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="What is the best antivirus software for Mac?"></a>What is the best antivirus software for Mac?</h2><p>ZDNet has reviewed and compared <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-antivirus" >the best antivirus software available in our guide here. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Are-there-alternatives-worth-considering"><a href="#Are-there-alternatives-worth-considering" class="headerlink" title="Are there alternatives worth considering?"></a>Are there alternatives worth considering?</h2><p>If you’re not sold on spending a ton of money on a Mac but still want the benefits of iOS, it’s worth looking into iPads since you can add attachments like keyboards that make them useable for work. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3HN1KC?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C27a585ee-b24b-4de1-9efb-504c5906de2c%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >BEST MAC FOR PORTABILITY iPad Air - Best Mac for portability The 5th Generation iPad Air comes armed with Apple’s M1 chip and a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display, all encased in a lightweight design.

But what is DVD resolution, and how does it compare to modern formats? Can we burn 720p or higher resolution video to a DVD? Can we upscale DVD resolution to 4K? How do DVDs look on 4K screen? </p><p>In this article, we delve into the world of DVD resolutions to uncover its intricacies and limitations. From the basics of DVD SD resolutions to how to make DVD quality better, we’ll explore why DVDs still matter in today’s digital landscape.</p><h2 id="Q1-What-is-the-Resolution-of-DVDs"><a href="#Q1-What-is-the-Resolution-of-DVDs" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What is the Resolution of DVDs?"></a>Q1. What is the Resolution of DVDs?</h2><h3 id="Are-DVDs-in-480p-720p-or-1080p"><a href="#Are-DVDs-in-480p-720p-or-1080p" class="headerlink" title="Are DVDs in 480p, 720p, or 1080p?"></a>Are DVDs in 480p, 720p, or 1080p?</h3><p>DVD resolution is the number of pixels displayed on the screen, typically expressed as width x height (e.g., 720x480). </p><ul><li>NTSC DVD resolution: 720 × 480 (total 345,600 pixels), 480i&#x2F;480p</li><li>PAL DVD resolution: 720 × 576 (total 414,720 pixels), 576i&#x2F;576p</li></ul><p>Both DVD resolutions are available in 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. Besides standard DVD resolution, some people also wonder what the HD DVD resolution is. </p><ul><li>HD DVD resolution: 1280 x 720 (720p), 1920 x 1080 (1080i&#x2F;1080p)</li></ul><p> So apparently, SD DVDs are not in 1080p or 720p. The max DVD resolution is 480i&#x2F;p or 576i&#x2F;p. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seo-img/dvd-ripper/dvd-resolution.jpg"                      alt="DVD resolution vs 720p vs 1080p vs 4K"                > </p><h3 id="Is-DVD-lower-quality-than-Blu-ray"><a href="#Is-DVD-lower-quality-than-Blu-ray" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD lower quality than Blu-ray?"></a>Is DVD lower quality than Blu-ray?</h3><p>Yes. The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXIq2G0nShk?si=5Z4Fwv7ZB6oKWsdd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwOwUI47FuU?si=NK7IEELjx7_SJSl2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

How to Make Standard DVDs Look Better on an HDTV?</h2><p><em>“I’m thinking of buying an HD TV, but I’m concerned about what my SD DVDs will look on it. I took a beautiful SD DVD of _The Asphalt Jungle_ with me to Best Buy, and they played it in an “upconverting” DVD player on both a 720p and a 1080p screen; it looked terrible on both, much worse than on my picture-tube TV. How to make it better? “</em></p><p>The visual effect is determined by various factors, such as DVD resolution, your display resolution, the display size and the distance between you and the TV. A 480p DVD is crystal enough on mobile phones. However, on 1080P widescreen HDTV, it’s barely clear. The image will be stretched based on the size of the TV and that will pixelate the image.</p><p>How to make DVDs look better on widescreen?

So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos. The highest DVD resolution is 720x480 or 720x576.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djPqRkskaBo?si=O6FEI-KVW0HwN417" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?"></a>How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?</h3><p>Here we will give you an example of how to burn a DVD with video in 720p resolution.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance. If you’re up close, you will see there is more black space between the pixels and the image seems to be a little bit fuzzy than before. </p><h4 id="Continue-Reading…"><a href="#Continue-Reading…" class="headerlink" title="Continue Reading…"></a>Continue Reading…</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >DVD vs Blu-ray vs Digital File: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >How to Free Rip DVD with Same Quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Best Settings to Rip DVDs Fast with Good Quality &amp; Small Size <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97ydpSmzTJw?si=tFcelmtQX4u-b3u5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Streaming vs DVD?

I spent about half of the year using both units. I had my Mint Mobile eSIM installed on the smaller iPhone 15 for the first three months and then transferred to the iPhone 15 Plus for the other half. A good part of my long-term evaluation process includes testing cellular connectivity (read: using the devices in crowded areas, on top of buildings, in subways, and more), day-to-day performance, and taking more photos than a standard free subscription to iCloud can contain.</p><p>The difference between the two latest iPhone handsets mainly boils down to display size and battery life; unlike the Pro models, there’s no camera hardware discrepancy, which means the general user experience of the two is pleasantly similar. That made my life as a phone reviewer a little easier – and makes the list below all the more applicable to both iPhone models.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMYEK2gtY5c?si=ytxNz_JHZkTrwb4b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features"><a href="#What-are-the-iPhone-15’s-best-features" class="headerlink" title="What are the iPhone 15’s best features?"></a>What are the iPhone 15’s best features?</h2><p><strong>Thinner, lighter form factor:</strong> Without question, the most important aspect of a phone is how it feels in hand – we carry these things around everywhere, all the time – and with the latest iPhone, it’s baffling how much more premium it feels compared to previous generations. Whether you’re coming from an iPhone XR or an iPhone 14, the glossy, sharp-cornered form factor of old pales compared to Apple’s new design language, which flaunts contoured edges and a color-infused, satin backing. Apple has always kept the matte finish exclusive to its Pro line, so I’m all for the iPhone 15 being a little more disruptive.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Less is more here, and Apple’s slimming down of the base-level iPhone has made it so comfortable in my hand that I didn’t – and still don’t – envy the Pro model’s titanium material one bit. The iPhone 15 also comes in more charming colors than the Pro line, with pastel – and emphasis on “pastel” – hues of green, yellow, pink, blue, and black. For me, matte black is king, easily matching my favorite (though flawed) <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/matte-black-iphone-7-paint-problems-if-its-finish-is-flaking-off-youre-not-alone/" >iPhone finish <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all time.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Island:</strong> The most notable display upgrade with the iPhone 15 is the Dynamic Island, carried over from the previous year’s iPhone 14 Pro. (The brighter 2,000-nit display comes in a close second.) It’s a feature that everyone can appreciate – whether you end up using it or not – because, unlike the notch that it replaced, the Dynamic Island turns that chunk of previously unused real estate into a glanceable status indicator system. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-you-shouldnt-buy-the-iphone-16-for-apple-intelligence/" >Why you shouldn’t buy the iPhone 6 for Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>You don’t <em>have</em> to interact with the Spotify music player or Uber Eats tracker that magically morphs into the pill-shaped cutout to appreciate its functionality. If you do, though, you’ll be glad you no longer have to open an app just to skip a track or know how much further away your game-day pizzas are. I’ve enjoyed using the <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy-beautiful-sun-tracker/id908905093" >Lumy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, which displays a timer for when golden hour ends, so I know exactly how long I have left to take those warm and dreamy photos before sunset.</p><p><strong>USB-C</strong> <strong>port:</strong> This one should be more straightforward than it seems, but Apple’s crisscrossing of <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-15s-usb-c-upgrade-may-have-serious-implications-for-the-charging-accessory-future/" >charging standards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and data transfer speeds means that it’s not. While the iPhone 15 now supports the universal USB-C port, meaning I no longer have to wrestle through my car’s center console for a Lightning cable or <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-usb-c-cables-for-the-iphone-15/" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on what phone I’m using, it’s not as powerful and fast as the one on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p><p>The iPhone 15 can also charge other phones and accessories, including this SmallRig video light that I use when filming.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The result is a slower charging rate (up to 18W) and data transfer speed (up to 480Mbps), which I haven’t found to be deal-breakers. Part of the reason is that the iPhone 15 Plus, in particular, has been an absolute endurance beast, lasting me well into a second workday before needing to be charged. It even beats the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s battery life, as reported by numerous testers.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ios-18-public-beta-is-available-for-iphone-right-now-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/" >The iOS 18 public beta is available for iPhone right now. How to download it (and which models support it) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Naturally, I’ve been topping it up when I’m deep at work or cooking, when how quickly the phone charges is the least of my worries. (Second note: The smaller iPhone 15’s battery life has been less spectacular, netting me well under a day of usage.) I’ve also gotten so used to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/how-to-airdrop/" >using AirDrop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and cloud services for file transfers, especially for time-sensitive photos and videos captured at press events, that the slower data transfer speed is insignificant to my workflow. </p><p><strong>48-megapixel camera:</strong> Speaking of which, both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a new 48MP main camera that defaults to 24MP capturing (by combining the low-light capabilities of a 12MP binned photo and the detail of the 48MP), and I was satisfied with its output. The iPhone’s color science leans more natural, prioritizing the finer details like subjects underneath shadows and how evenly lit everything in the frame is.</p><p>Here’s the Wythe Hotel captured with the iPhone 15 Plus’ 12-megapixel ultrawide lens.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The image above, when captured on a Samsung Galaxy S23 or a OnePlus 11, made the sky more blue, the trees unnaturally vibrant, and the traffic lights a more polarizing neon yellow. Of course, which camera output is better comes down to personal preference, and in some cases, I actually prefer the more processed but ready-to-share stills that I get from a competing <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/" >Android device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-decluttered-my-iphone-and-freed-up-gigs-of-space-heres-how/" >I decluttered my iPhone and freed up gigs of space. Here’s how <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The iPhone 15’s 48MP camera can also function as a telephoto lens with a 2x zoom. Apple calls it a 2x “optical” zoom, but from what I’ve seen when comparing the optically zoomed photo to one I manually cropped in, the difference is negligible. As for low-light photography, I’m glad to see Apple embracing the darkness and not making an otherwise moody, sunsetting environment look like the middle of the day, as depicted below.</p><p>Tip: iOS 17 gives you a leveler in the camera app to help you frame and straighten photos just right.</p><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>With the iPhone 15’s camera system, its video capabilities stand out to me the most. Of all the phones I’ve tested, nothing comes close to the raw output that I get from an iPhone camera, from the image stabilization that doesn’t make a buzzing effect every step that I take to how consistent colors are when switching between the main wide lens to the ultrawide.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone"><a href="#Should-I-upgrade-from-my-older-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?"></a>Should I upgrade from my older iPhone?</h2><p>It’s true that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-users-keep-their-phones-longer-than-android-owners/" >consumers are now upgrading their smartphones at a slower rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, spending three years or more with their devices before switching to the next best thing. If you’re coming from an older iPhone model, here’s how it stacks up with the iPhone 15 and the biggest differences you can expect.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>If you’re upgrading from…</strong></th><th><strong>The biggest differences are…</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>iPhone X or iPhone XR</strong></td><td>If you’re coming from an iPhone X, you’ll now be able to experience iOS 17, which features StandBy Mode, Contact Posters, Live Voicemail, Interactive widgets, and more. See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 11</strong></td><td>The iPhone 15 supports 5G connectivity and a much sharper and brighter OLED display (versus the iPhone 11’s LCD). See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 12</strong></td><td>For iPhone Mini users, the standard iPhone 15 is your best bet if you still want a relatively compact form factor with all the latest iOS perks. The iPhone 15 also comes with a base storage of 128GB, double that of the iPhone 12. See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 13</strong></td><td>Prepare to convert your physical SIM card to an eSIM. You’ll also gain access to Apple’s Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection safety features. See below for everything else you gain.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>iPhone 14</strong></td><td>The Dynamic Island, 48MP camera, thinner design, and USB-C port are the most notable upgrades from the iPhone 14. And, assuming you’ve converted to eSIM, the contacts transferring process should be very seamless.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model"><a href="#What-I’d-like-to-see-in-the-next-model" class="headerlink" title="What I’d like to see in the next model"></a>What I’d like to see in the next model</h2><p>Kerry Wan&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p><strong>90Hz refresh rate, if not 120Hz:</strong> My biggest critique of the iPhone 15 is its display refresh rate. Not everyone will notice the difference between a 60Hz panel and a 120Hz panel, but as someone who carries a secondary Android phone at all times, it’s hard not to acknowledge the less fluid iPhone display. This may also be a dealbreaker if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro and have gotten used to the Pro Motion panels.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-uncovered-8-cool-ways-to-use-lidar-on-an-iphone-and-ipad/" >I uncovered 8 cool ways to use LiDAR on an iPhone and iPad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Is this Apple’s way of splitting up the non-Pro and Pro models? Probably. I don’t take for granted that fewer animations mean the iPhone 15 is more battery efficient than the Pro, but in a world where even sub-$200 phones have 120Hz displays, I really wish that Apple gave its $800 iPhone something smoother on the eyes.</p><p><strong>An Action button:</strong> Given how many iPhone 14 Pro features Apple carried over to the iPhone 15, I have my fingers crossed that Apple will replace the alert slider with the Action button this year. Over the course of testing the latest iPhones, I’ve used the alert slider less than a dozen times. An Action button would give the iPhone much more functionality.</p><h2 id="Final-thought"><a href="#Final-thought" class="headerlink" title="Final thought"></a>Final thought</h2><p>It’s easy to call the standard iPhone model the “Best iPhone for most people.” That’s been the case since Apple introduced a Pro variant with the iPhone 11 series, and still holds true with the <a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >iPhone 15 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only now, I’m finding myself recommending the non-Pro iPhone to more users than ever before, including folks I’ve known to be more demanding of their tech. Apple’s made just enough feature upgrades (and a few compromises that may be imperceivable to some) to help the latest iPhone model stand out, even when stacked against the generation before it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBnnLFJbvr4?si=LlHYrYlOBp7NLMec" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alternatives-to-consider"><a href="#Alternatives-to-consider" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to consider"></a>Alternatives to consider</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-14&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >BEST IPHONE 15 ALTERNATIVE Apple iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus Apple still sells the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, and with a $100 discount, so if you don’t need the latest features – and want to save yourself a Benjamin – they’re both viable alternatives.

My kids are in middle and high school, with a college student in the mix as well. Our family has found different tech tools helpful at various points in their educational journeys.</em></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SbYznUy_zY?si=ThBkP934r3mizi48" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals"><a href="#Must-Haves-Computers-Laptops-and-Peripherals" class="headerlink" title="Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals"></a>Must-Haves: Computers, Laptops and Peripherals</h2><p> Does your child need a laptop or a desktop computer? It could be that they need both, plus accessories (known as peripherals) like mice, webcams, and headphones.</p><p> Laptops are great for letting kids work when they’re on a school bus, waiting for a ride, or hanging out anywhere there is a Wi-Fi connection. They don’t always have the same power and capabilities, however, that a desktop PC might. But for completing most middle- and high-school assignments, they should work just fine.</p><p> Some schools or districts provide students with Chromebooks free of charge; others don’t. On the other hand, college students are almost always expected to provide their own devices (like laptops or computers).</p><p> Depending on your child’s situation, you might need to budget this year for a new laptop or desktop computer, or you might be able to get away with adding just a few peripherals like a new mouse, webcam, or speakers.</p><p> Beware of school policies around Chromebook lending. In most cases, parents must sign releases indicating they will be responsible for anything that might happen to the device. That can put you on the hook for a spendy replacement or repair you might not be ready for. Schools do have other options they can give you, including requiring the student to keep the Chromebook at school or providing them with paper assignments instead.</p><p> The real trick is deciding what you need to buy. While it’s tempting to purchase the cheapest items, that can backfire because “inexpensive” sometimes translates into cheap materials that can’t withstand your child’s activities or the occasional tossed backpack. Less expensive devices may also lack the speed or power to do everything your student needs them to.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/editor-s-choice-the-best-tech-gifts-for-back-to-school-7692969" >Editor’s Choice: The Best Tech Gifts for Back To School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5xqW8ViVbQNgb2VUsUblogbwFco=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Studentswithlaptopsondesksandbeanbags_skynesher_GettyImages-1456220436CROPPED-19c3059f597a4aa1b038835c96bacc75.jpg"                      alt="Students using laptops at tables and in bean bag chairs."                ></p><p>Skynesher&#x2F;Getty</p><p> For example, if your child is a STEM kid or a graphic artist, more power and storage are necessary overall. On the other hand, kids who just need to manage basic projects and complete homework on time will probably do fine with a standard Chromebook.  </p><p> As you make your purchases, consider how long the item will last with your child. Some kids are rough on technology, while others are more thoughtful and responsible; age often dictates how nice I’m willing to purchase for a specific child.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoC2TGp1PLY?si=iH9xs76NhWn4pP-E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Look-for-Student-Discounts"><a href="#Look-for-Student-Discounts" class="headerlink" title="Look for Student Discounts"></a>Look for Student Discounts</h3><p> Check for discounts before you buy!

They can also set appointments and reminders, for example, and create to-do lists to help them stay organized.</p><p> While parental controls and rules should always apply, I’ve found there are a variety of mobile apps that have been useful for helping my kids get and stay organized.

The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp78eFEGwVU?si=-4orJBLvJJrggCJ2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

How to Make Standard DVDs Look Better on an HDTV?</h2><p><em>“I’m thinking of buying an HD TV, but I’m concerned about what my SD DVDs will look on it. I took a beautiful SD DVD of _The Asphalt Jungle_ with me to Best Buy, and they played it in an “upconverting” DVD player on both a 720p and a 1080p screen; it looked terrible on both, much worse than on my picture-tube TV. How to make it better? “</em></p><p>The visual effect is determined by various factors, such as DVD resolution, your display resolution, the display size and the distance between you and the TV. A 480p DVD is crystal enough on mobile phones. However, on 1080P widescreen HDTV, it’s barely clear. The image will be stretched based on the size of the TV and that will pixelate the image.</p><p>How to make DVDs look better on widescreen?

And you think you are holding a 1280x720 resolution DVD. Well, actually you omit an important link. </p><p>The truth is that DVD authoring software always automatically converts video to standard DVD resolution for burning. So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance. If you’re up close, you will see there is more black space between the pixels and the image seems to be a little bit fuzzy than before. </p><h4 id="Continue-Reading…"><a href="#Continue-Reading…" class="headerlink" title="Continue Reading…"></a>Continue Reading…</h4><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >DVD vs Blu-ray vs Digital File: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >How to Free Rip DVD with Same Quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Best Settings to Rip DVDs Fast with Good Quality &amp; Small Size <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/seoimg/icon1.png"                                     ></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >Streaming vs DVD?

I’ve used Google’s free email service for many years. It has a modern feel, is tightly integrated with the company’s other services, and does a good job of blocking spam.</p><p> It has some<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gmail-tips-tricks-and-tutorials-1172146" >other nifty features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , too, such as the option to snooze emails for later, schedule emails to be sent in the future, and read mail offline. You can also send emails that expire and require a unique code to open, store messages in a 15 GB vault, share files from your cloud storage account, undo sending messages, and set up vacation responses.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-bard-7151624" >Google’s Gemini service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is even built-in (if you opt-in).</p><p> I love how closely connected Gmail is with the company’s other products. This means I can use my account to collaborate with people on projects or hold virtual meetings.</p><p> There are themes you can apply to Gmail’s interface to customize how it appears so it feels more like your space. Some other things I like include access to tons of advanced settings, the ability to create filters and labels, and the option to import email from other email accounts. There are also gadgets (add-ons) to extend Gmail’s functionality.</p><p> All addresses end in_gmail.com_ .</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>02</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Outlook"><a href="#Outlook" class="headerlink" title="Outlook"></a><a class="link"   href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/" >Outlook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H-eJC9BjhHDNlttlpKjOcwFqn0Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/outlook-email-96b6e0e2cb634079b2fd23872831e774.png"                      alt="Emails in an Outlook.com account"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpdGEJJwMLY?si=eKgXOPpNeYvYKcel" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Clean interface that’s easy to use.</li><li>Works closely with other Microsoft services.</li><li>Organizes mail automatically.</li><li>Multiple account aliases hide your actual email address.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Sometimes takes a while to load.</li><li>Shows a giant banner ad.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/outlook-com-review-2483268" >Outlook.com vs. Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Outlook is Microsoft’s free email service that, like Gmail, has a solid interface that’s easy to navigate. In my experience, it’s easily second to Google’s service or even tied as the best free email provider.</p><p> The website is intuitive; it’s as easy as right-clicking an email to find further options that include moving and deleting messages and searching for every email from that one sender.</p><p> Outlook supports mail rules, which means you can set new messages to move to a specified folder automatically and be categorized, flagged, or forwarded if certain conditions are met. You can also connect directly to Skype through your email and use add-ons such as DocuSign.</p><p> All of Microsoft’s other products are woven together nicely through Outlook. You can easily access OneNote, Excel, Word, Calendar, and more, right from your email.</p><p> Your address can end with_outlook.com_  or_hotmail.com_ (yes, it’s still around!).</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>03</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Proton-Mail"><a href="#Proton-Mail" class="headerlink" title="Proton Mail"></a><a class="link"   href="https://proton.me/mail" >Proton Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2A5ZBpitET9klvQvOoZKvrgjXK4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/proton-mail-09e4a81823e3432fa07c5076fb0e8ec9.png"                      alt="ProtonMail inbox"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Relies heavily on encrypting email data.</li><li>Send encrypted emails to anyone, even if they don’t use Proton Mail.</li><li>Choose when an email will expire.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Limited to 1 GB of storage.</li><li>Free account limited to 150 messages per day.</li><li>No vacation replies.</li><li>Supports only three folders and labels.</li><li>Limited scheduling options for free users.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/protonmail-review-4107075" >Our Review of Proton Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The main difference between Proton Mail and the other services is that this one is centered around email encryption. The idea is that you can send mail without fear that the people at Proton Mail or anyone else besides the recipient can read the message.</p><p> Messages sent to other Proton Mail users are always encrypted. You can also encrypt messages you send to non-users. I love the options here. If you encrypt a message, you can set an expiration time (up to four weeks) so that it’s destroyed and unreadable after the duration you specify!</p><p> Recipients who receive encrypted messages open the email through a link that asks for the password, where it’s decrypted and displayed in the browser. They can reply through an encrypted channel via the same message they decrypted and don’t need a Proton Mail account.</p><p> I like that Proton Mail includes encryption features for free, but 1 GB is quite low for email storage (and you actually start with 500 MB; the rest you can unlock for free). The per-day message limit doesn’t seem like as big of a problem, at least not for me, but you’ll definitely feel that limitation if you’re a heavy email user.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/you-should-encrypt-your-email-2486679" >Here’s why and how to encrypt your email <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Another privacy-minded feature is Link Confirmation, which guards against phishing attacks by displaying a pop-up window when you select a link, letting you confirm where it goes before actually going there.</p><p> Email addresses can end as_proton.me_ or_protonmail.com_ .</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/proton-mail-encrypted-email/id979659905" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.protonmail.android" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>04</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Yahoo-Mail"><a href="#Yahoo-Mail" class="headerlink" title="Yahoo Mail"></a><a class="link"   href="https://overview.mail.yahoo.com/" >Yahoo Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sU-JXf-rjXc7JEILC7Oc5ZE5rQQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/yahoo-mail-ad1701b87a104041b1841b2889d75d13.png"                      alt="Yahoo Mail email inbox"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWcXdTn5SE?si=QbxEkX-4a17J5RVs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Tons of email storage space.</li><li>Lets you make free disposable email addresses.</li><li>Includes a built-in GIF database.</li><li>Using Yahoo Calendar from the email area is easy.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Not as many filters&#x2F;rules as other email providers.</li></ul><p> The main reason I like Yahoo Mail is that every person who signs up gets 1 TB of free storage. This is way more space than the majority of email providers, so it’s a good choice if you’re looking for an email account that can store years’ worth of messages and attachments.</p><p> The Compose window is similar to Gmail, but with one helpful difference: it’s easy to switch between inline image attachments and regular file attachments. This is important if you need to describe the context for your images, something hard to do when they’re stored as attachments.</p><p> This is probably the best email service when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-email-alias-4689556" >alternate identities or aliases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can create disposable addresses (up to three for free) linked to your inbox without revealing your actual address. This is helpful when you sign up for accounts and don’t want your regular inbox spammed or filled with useless emails; delete the disposable address if the spam becomes too overwhelming.</p><p> I’m also a big fan of how Yahoo Mail organizes things. All the photos, documents, receipts, and travel details that show up in my email are collected in their own areas. It’s far easier to look through those items this way than searching for their emails and opening each attachment.</p><p> Here are some other things I like about Yahoo’s approach to email: insert GIFs from a built-in GIF collection, use themes that change the background and color scheme of the website, import contacts from a file on your computer and other accounts like Facebook or Outlook, use a built-in notepad, attach files from Google Drive or Dropbox, easily attach files to an email that were sent to you recently, and connect external accounts so you can use one interface to manage email.</p><p> When you sign up, you can make your address end in_yahoo.com_ or_myyahoo.com_ .</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yahoo-mail-organized-email/id577586159" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.mail" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>05</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="iCloud-Mail"><a href="#iCloud-Mail" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Mail"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/mail" >iCloud Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w_acnV8MBdPn4-ciceRK00WKSYc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/icloud-mail-5afed13dfa6bcc0036e3ac4f.PNG"                      alt="iCloud Mail"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Unsubscribing from email lists is easy.</li><li>Includes 5 GB of free online storage.</li><li>Works from a computer or mobile device.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Not as advanced as some other providers.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/icloud-mail-review-1172292" >Our Review of iCloud Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> iCloud Mail is an interesting service because many people don’t realize they’re only a few steps away from having one. It’s free to anyone who signs up for an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-apple-id-1994330" >Apple ID <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but it isn’t limited only to Apple products. Anyone can get a free iCloud ID and access iCloud Mail on their computer.</p><p> Once you make an account, you can log in from any computer and access a suite of products in addition to your mail, like notes, reminders, photos,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-icloud-3972867" >iCloud Drive content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , contacts, calendar events, and anything else that’s been synced to iCloud from your iOS device.</p><p> The email portion of iCloud isn’t super advanced and probably won’t serve you well if you want lots of options. However, it’s effortless to set up, and you don’t have to go through a tedious process of adding your name and choosing a password. All of this works well with your existing Apple ID or a new free iCloud account.</p><p> The 5 GB of free storage for emails and other iCloud files is a plus compared to some of these other services that offer much less space. You also get IMAP support, forwarding options, large file attachment support (up to 5 GB via Mail Drop), and a two-click method to unsubscribe from unwanted emails.</p><p> New accounts end with <em>icloud.com</em> .</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/mail" >Visit iCloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>06</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Tuta"><a href="#Tuta" class="headerlink" title="Tuta"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tuta.com/" >Tuta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QJuKx-B118vphcRrC7pLrccc_z8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tuta-free-email-248d1566745f4c88bfbe3cd0d302c8f7.png"                      alt="The New Email prompt at Tuta Mail"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Encrypts email automatically.</li><li>Send encrypted emails to non-users.</li><li>Several domain options for new accounts.</li><li>Requires a strong email password.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>Includes only 1 GB of storage space.</li><li>Some features require a paid account.</li><li>Deletes unused accounts after just six months.</li></ul><p> Self-described as the “world’s most secure email service,” Tuta (formerly Tutanota) is similar to Proton Mail in that it automatically encrypts your emails. However, you can disable end-to-end encryption if you’d like.</p><p> One thing that stands out to me is that you can’t create your account until you make a secure password. Some places urge you to make your password stronger, but still will accept it; Tuta_requires_ it.</p><p> The web interface is straightforward and provides menu transitions that bring together the mail folders and email settings. When sending messages to non-users, you can make them password-protected or keep them unencrypted. If a password is designated, the recipient gets a custom link to open the message; they must enter the password to read and reply.</p><p> A neat feature is that when the user responds to an email not using Tuta, the messages are still contained within the temporary account. You can have back-and-forth communication with any other email service, and the recipient can keep the link open the entire time.</p><p> Even though it isn’t as well known as Gmail or Yahoo, Tuta lets you have an email signature, use up to 1 GB of storage, and automatically add emailed recipients as new contacts. Premium features like offline storage and smart filtering can be had for a cost.</p><p> You can make an account with any of these domains: <em>tutanota.com, tutanota.de, tutamail.com, tuta.io, keemail.me</em> . Paying subscribers also have_tuta.com_ as a choice_._</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/private-secure-email-tutanota/id922429609" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.tutao.tutanota" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>07</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="Yandex-Mail"><a href="#Yandex-Mail" class="headerlink" title="Yandex Mail"></a><a class="link"   href="https://360.yandex.com/mail/" >Yandex Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/82p_aFODzg3ro3jmqbUYSRVdA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/yandex-mail-30f9ebbff5954531b460ae29d40a882e.png"                      alt="An email open in Yandex Mail"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>Free storage for email and other Yandex services.</li><li>Lets you sign up with an existing social-media or Gmail account.</li><li>Reminds you if the recipient doesn’t respond after a specified number of days.</li><li>Includes a built-in translator.</li><li>Countdown to cancel sent emails.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>2FA requires a special Yandex app (most providers use Google Authenticator).</li><li>Can’t change the 24-hour time format.</li><li>Trouble logging in at times.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/yandex-mail-review-1170798" >Yandex.Mail: The Good and Bad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Yandex is a Russian company that provides many tools and free email accounts, such as 5 GB of online storage, a calendar, and a search engine. Like Google, your Yandex email makes it possible to access these services using one login.</p><p> The interface is friendly. It’s easy to read and provides a simple layout while still keeping all the necessary tools intact. Like most other providers in this list, this one supports email filters, contact importing and exporting, tasks, and hotkeys.</p><p> However, it’s also unique in many ways that make it one of the better ones out there. You can forward multiple messages with ease; they are sent as file attachments. Delayed messaging is supported, you can be notified when an email is received and reminded later if you don’t get a reply, and the part after @ can be your website domain name (for free).</p><p> The reason I list this lower than the rest is because I occasionally have trouble logging in. For some reason, the website thinks something suspicious is going on, and I’ll be locked out until I can verify my identity. When this happens, I’m able to get back in with no problem and all my emails are still there.</p><p> All addresses end with <em>yandex.com</em> .</p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-mail-email-app/id441785419" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.mail" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>08</p><p>of 10</p><h2 id="AOL-Mail"><a href="#AOL-Mail" class="headerlink" title="AOL Mail"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.aol.com/" >AOL Mail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fmPyWPLETFWZS5zg3BYZt-QjHNA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/aol-mail-afe56902b0334cb0a542d11e4f7bac82.png"                      alt="AOL Mail inbox"                ></p><p> What We Like</p><ul><li>A calendar and to-do list are easily accessible from the email page.</li><li>Selection of themes to choose from.</li><li>Can check spelling before sending every email.</li></ul><p> What We Don’t Like</p><ul><li>It’s easy to accidentally open the news section instead of your email.</li><li>Lots of ads.</li><li>Some features require a paid AOL Desktop Gold subscription.</li></ul><p> AOL Mail is another free email account option that’s actually very similar to Yahoo Mail in some ways.

AOL Mail can also block mail senders and lets you configure filters.</p><p> Much like Yahoo Mail, writing an email from this service includes access to a GIF gallery and stationery. The same handy collections for photos and documents are also included here.</p><p> Your AOL.com account comes with a calendar and to-do list that are accessible from the inbox.

Zoho Mail is its free email service.</p><p> When composing a message for the first time, I noticed the minimal, tabbed design, that lets me quickly switch between the new email box and the rest of my mail. Everything feels way more accessible this way.</p><p> The Streams feature makes it easy to create groups where you and your team members can interact with shared messages and attachments. It works a bit like a private social media site.</p><p> I also really like SecurePass. If you click the lock while making a new email, you can set up the message to automatically expire on a certain day. Also, when this is turned on, recipients won’t be able to forward, copy, print, or download the email. Very cool!</p><p> All the standard compose tools are included, but you can also add files from Zoho Docs, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, and other services and include tables in your messages. It also lets you create new notes and tasks, use keyboard shortcuts, enable filters for auto-management, share email drafts with contacts, set up vacation replies, and send custom domains to an allow or block list.</p><p> Free accounts are limited to 5 GB of storage and 25 MB attachments, but that’s still pretty good assuming you’re not a super heavy user.</p><p> All addresses end as <em>zohomail.com.</em></p><p><strong>Download For</strong> :</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zoho-mail-email-and-calendar/id909262651" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoho.mail" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7fATC_lI7o?si=UFotPJqflDRZr-mv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Choosing-a-Free-Email-Service"><a href="#Tips-for-Choosing-a-Free-Email-Service" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Choosing a Free Email Service"></a>Tips for Choosing a Free Email Service</h2><p> When you pick an email account, look for a few characteristics to help you determine which is best for you.

MKV is the format that will contain all the video, audio, subtitle tracks, chapters, and menus of a DVD without quality loss. And MKV can provide better compatibility than some other formats like ISO image or DVD VIDEO_TS folder. But you may don’t want to transcode a DVD to MKV and lose some video quality. You may just want to extract the DVD video to MKV format, untouched. In this post, we will show you the right way to rip DVD to MKV without re-encoding.</p><h2 id="Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss"><a href="#Easily-Rip-DVDs-to-MKV-without-Quality-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss"></a>Easily Rip DVDs to MKV without Quality Loss</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/" >WinX DVD Ripper Platinum <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - easily rip DVD to MKV, ISO image, MPG, and Video_TS folder in <strong>1:1 quality</strong>.

Google, Samsung, Microsoft, and Opera… they’ve all injected AI into their products. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Apple has been slow to the starting line with this divisive technology and is having to play catch-up.</p><p>Apple has already announced that <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >ChatGPT will be part of Apple Intelligence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and rumors have been circulating for months that Apple could give Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude the same treatment. Apple was talking to Google about adding Gemini into iOS as far <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-in-talks-to-bring-googles-gemini-ai-models-to-the-iphone-as-early-as-this-year/" >back as March <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, at least. Apple will likely announce its choices this fall, when Apple Intelligence arrives in beta.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/" >Everything to know about Apple’s AI features coming to iPhones, Macs, and iPads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Why would Gemini’s addition be a good thing? Let me explain through the eyes of an Android user.</p><p>From my experience, it’s all about interaction. Sure, Google Assistant and Siri make it possible to interact with your phone, but with Gemini, this goes a few steps further thanks to contextual awareness.</p><p>Gemini is capable of digging deeper into a subject than Google Assistant. Instead of having Google Assistant open online articles, Gemini can communicate the same information via a conversation. Not only is that more efficient, it also helps you avoid going to websites that are riddled with so many ads that the default mobile browser becomes useless and the page impossible to read. I would much rather have a conversation than have to trudge through an ad-infested website that doesn’t render properly on a mobile browser.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Furthermore, Gemini is capable of interacting with other applications, such as Gmail, Google Keep, and more. With such integration, you can do far more than with the old-school assistant technology. Instead of limiting yourself to single interactions, you can dig deeper.</p><p>For example, with Google Assistant, you could view a list of flights for your upcoming vacation. With Gemini, you can plan the entire trip, including flights, hotels, and activities.</p><p>Since I shifted from Google Assistant to Gemini, I’ve found the latter to be far more useful. In fact, when Google Assistant was the default, I rarely used it. With Gemini, I find myself accessing the digital assistant far more.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-google-gemini/" >What is Gemini? Everything you should know about Google’s new AI model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>I believe iOS and MacOS users will feel the same way about Apple Intelligence. With a more interactive assistant, Apple device owners will feel that the technology is more of a help than a hindrance. In fact, if Apple users are anything like me, their reaction will be along the lines of, “This is what Siri should have been all along!”</p><p>Along with the possible addition of Google Gemini, <a class="link"   href="https://www.androidpolice.com/gemini-support-apple-intelligence-coming-months/" >Android Police <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also reporting the possibility of a new paid plan for Apple Intelligence. The article states this could be a “long-term plan,” which makes me believe Apple will roll out Apple Intelligence for all users for free, but could eventually start adding paid features.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/"  title="We&#39;ve used every iPhone 16 model and here&#39;s our best buying advice for 2024">We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/"  title="20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really">20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/"  title="My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I&#39;m not alone)">My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/"  title="Want a programming job?

The maximum resolution of DVD are 720x480 pixels (NTSC) or 720x576 pixels (PAL), while Blu-ray offers much higher resolution of up to 1920x1080 pixels (Full HD) or even 3840x2160 pixels (4K Ultra HD). Blu-ray discs also support higher-quality audio formats, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, providing more immersive surround sound experiences compared to the compressed audio formats used in DVDs. </p><p>In addition, Blu-ray discs use more advanced video compression technologies, such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) or HEVC (H.265), allowing for higher-quality video with less compression artifacts compared to the MPEG-2 compression used in DVDs. Therefore, DVD is considered lower quality compared to Blu-ray. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC-HtDQVoG0?si=nQcoa7q8q2IL8U0m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming"><a href="#Is-DVD-higher-quality-than-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Is DVD higher quality than streaming?"></a>Is DVD higher quality than streaming?</h3><p>Yes. DVDs typically have SD resolutions. In contrast, streaming services can offer resolutions up to 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels) or even higher. This means that streaming services can provide significantly sharper and more detailed images compared to DVDs. Meanwhile, streaming services allow access to a wide range of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original productions compared to DVDs. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAkb8Bv3AU4?si=2rHwnZYTzTLieKgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality"><a href="#Will-upscaled-DVD-provide-better-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?"></a>Will upscaled DVD provide better video quality?</h3><p>Upscaling a DVD can improve its visual quality to some extent, but it won’t magically turn it into high-definition or 4K quality. When you upscale a DVD to a higher resolution, you’re essentially stretching the existing pixels to fill the larger screen size. While this can result in a modest improvement in image quality, especially on smaller displays, it won’t match the level of detail and clarity of true HD or 4K content.</p><p>Therefore, when you try to upscale DVD resolution, try starting at a little higher resolution, such as 640P or 720P. </p><h2 id="Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV"><a href="#Q2-How-to-Make-Standard-DVDs-Look-Better-on-an-HDTV" class="headerlink" title="Q2.

How to Make Standard DVDs Look Better on an HDTV?</h2><p><em>“I’m thinking of buying an HD TV, but I’m concerned about what my SD DVDs will look on it. I took a beautiful SD DVD of _The Asphalt Jungle_ with me to Best Buy, and they played it in an “upconverting” DVD player on both a 720p and a 1080p screen; it looked terrible on both, much worse than on my picture-tube TV. How to make it better? “</em></p><p>The visual effect is determined by various factors, such as DVD resolution, your display resolution, the display size and the distance between you and the TV. A 480p DVD is crystal enough on mobile phones. However, on 1080P widescreen HDTV, it’s barely clear. The image will be stretched based on the size of the TV and that will pixelate the image.</p><p>How to make DVDs look better on widescreen?

And you think you are holding a 1280x720 resolution DVD. Well, actually you omit an important link. </p><p>The truth is that DVD authoring software always automatically converts video to standard DVD resolution for burning. So to some extent, we can give you a positive answer: yes, it is possible to burn a DVD with 720p HD video or video in higher resolution, because all 720p&#x2F;1080p&#x2F;4K videos will be downscaled to 480p&#x2F;576p. But seriously, there is no way to make a DVD with HD resolution videos. The highest DVD resolution is 720x480 or 720x576.</p><h3 id="How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Burn-DVD-with-720p-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?"></a>How to Burn DVD with 720p Videos?</h3><p>Here we will give you an example of how to burn a DVD with video in 720p resolution. First you need to download DVD Author software. You can use <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/"><strong>WinX DVD Author</strong></a>, a 100% clean freeware, to burn video to DVD.

Some Blu-ray Disc players are equipped with 4K upscaling feature. If the player can’t do the upscaling, the 4K UHD TV will upscale the 1080p signal from the Blu-ray Disc player to 4K. 4K TV upscales the image, spreading 1 pixel to 16&#x2F;4x4 pixels.</p><p> Do DVDs look bad on 4K TV? There will be no difference on visual effect only if you are watching at a certain distance.

It has been updated every year or so since then to reflect new tools and workflows.</em></p><p>Remember the old productivity and office suites we all used to use? I don’t know about you, but my mix of productivity tools has certainly changed over the years. What I use today is vastly different from my daily productivity “suite” of years past.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/office-365-vs-g-suite-which-productivity-suite-is-best-for-your-business/"><strong>Office 365 vs Google Workspace: Which productivity suite is best</strong></a></p><p>Before I take you through both the tools and my “process,” let me point out that this stuff is different for everyone. My work these days consists far more of educating and communicating, and far less time spent living in spreadsheets than back in the days when I ran startups. </p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FWCFI3f_cs?si=Kt2Onr_E4c616tbH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="See-also"><a href="#See-also" class="headerlink" title="See also"></a>See also</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-to-do-list-app/" >The 6 best to-do list apps: Get organized What is the best to-do list app? Any.do! But ZDNet reviewed all the top picks to help you organize and liberate your life.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Today, I coordinate with teams, rather than manage them. I have students rather than employees. I research projects rather than launch products. My daily productivity flow reflects the changes in career as I’ve evolved from founder to advisor, manager to professor, and publisher to columnist. </p><p>I use a tremendous number of tools for my projects, and they often change from project to project. But what I’m going to discuss here are the tools I use on a daily basis to manage my “flow”. </p><h2 id="What-do-I-mean-by-my-flow"><a href="#What-do-I-mean-by-my-flow" class="headerlink" title="What do I mean by my flow?"></a>What do I mean by my flow?</h2><p>I divide my work day into two main chunks of time: Communications and knowledge gathering time, and project time. Every day has pretty much the same communications and knowledge gathering activities, which follows a relatively consistent pattern that has proven to be highly productive for me. These are the daily productivity activities I’ve been talking about. </p><p>In my case, morning to mid-afternoon is that daily productivity time. That’s when I connect with and follow-up with all my constituents, students, editors, producers, etc., when I do my daily reading to keep up with both news and new technology, and when I manage my schedule, schedule my tasks, make calls, and write and respond to email. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-a-smart-office-make-your-team-more-productive-too/"><strong>Can a smart office make your team more productive too?</strong></a></p><p>That whole process is my flow. Over my many various iterations, I’ve managed to optimize this process so I’m able to get a tremendous amount done in a relatively short amount of time.</p><p>The other half of my day is project time. This is when I work on everything from academic papers to the presentations, white papers, and webcasts I do for ZDNet to developing code to most of the projects I write about for DIY-IT. I tend to work on projects in the late afternoon and the late evening, with a break in the early evening for family time and lunch or dinner. </p><h2 id="Changes-due-to-the-pandemic"><a href="#Changes-due-to-the-pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Changes due to the pandemic"></a>Changes due to the pandemic</h2><p>The last time I updated this guide was in early 2019. Obviously, a few things have happened since then. In terms of my daily productivity, I go out a lot less than I used to. Back then, I was often running from place to place and had to build up an everyday carry (EDC) that could allow me to dive into any project or work with any team no matter where I was. I had EDC kits for a coffee shop programming run and EDC kits for week long conference work. I even built an EDC for <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/road-tech-how-i-left-florida-to-escape-irma-and-never-went-back/" >emergency evacuation of an indeterminate time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-inside-gewirtzs-home-office-20-years-of-refinement-and-evolution/"><strong>What’s inside Gewirtz’s home office? 20 years of refinement and evolution</strong></a></p><p>Now, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-inside-gewirtzs-home-office-20-years-of-refinement-and-evolution/" >mostly I’m home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If I’m out, it’s a dedicated out-and-back with a specific purpose. There is no meandering, browsing, or schmoozing. Yes, I know other people may feel comfortable going back to the pre-pandemic normal, but I have reasons for playing it a bit more safe than most might.</p><p>In any case, what that means is that instead of my escalating ranking of phones, tablets, Chromebooks and laptops, I just carry my <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dont-buy-that-expensive-new-iphone-13-how-used-iphones-can-deliver-huge-savings/" >iPhone 12 Pro Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It will keep me up to speed until I get back home and can pick up where I left off.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaM818fFKXQ?si=ZZLA4lFSHSgCpSE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tools-for-my-daily-flow"><a href="#Tools-for-my-daily-flow" class="headerlink" title="Tools for my daily flow"></a>Tools for my daily flow</h2><p>Now that you understand how my working environment has changed and how I structure my work day, let’s discuss the tools I use in my daily flow. It all starts with Gmail… </p><h2 id="First-morning-Gmail"><a href="#First-morning-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="First morning Gmail"></a>First morning Gmail</h2><p>It’s been quite a while since <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-bit-the-bullet-and-finally-switched-from-outlook-to-gmail/" >I made the switch from Outlook to Gmail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and I have to tell you, my productivity has improved tremendously, and after more than half a decade of use, I don’t regret the move one bit. Having the exact same email interface on all my machines, with tight integration into my iPhone, iPad, and computers, has made all the difference. </p><p>I no longer have thousands of unruly items filling my inbox. In fact, that’s a big part of what this daily productivity process is all about. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/help-i-have-100000-unread-messages-in-my-gmail-inbox-where-do-i-even-start-ask-zdnet/"><strong>Help! I have 100,000 unread messages in my Gmail inbox. How do I get to Inbox Zero?</strong></a></p><p>My day starts with my alarm going off. From under the covers, I usually reach over to my phone, painfully crack one eye open, tap the Gmail app, and scan to see if there’s anything on fire. </p><p>Actually, scratch that. I no longer take my iPhone to bed with me. Instead, I wear my <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-fitness-and-how-to-use-it/" >Apple Watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When I wake up, I can still glance at my notifications, but by leaving the tiny computers outside of the bedroom, I’m not tempted to check on work, read my mail, or play Wordle when I should be sleeping.</p><p>The boy</p><p>The way I have Gmail set up, only the most important messages show up on my watch. Same with Slack notifications. Basically, unless there’s something urgent from one of my editors, I can start my day in peace. If there’s nothing urgent, I hit the snooze button. After repeating this ritual two or three times, I get up, do my morning necessaries, and zombie-walk to the coffee maker. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/" >The best smartwatches Apple, Samsung, and others battle for your wrist.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Once I have coffee in hand, I navigate <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-crowdsourced-my-puppys-name/" >the puppy’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tower defense strategy for the morning, trying not to get my toes bit, spill my coffee, or step on one of his well-chewed stuffed animal friends. Eventually, I reach the couch, flip on my couch-side monitor, and once again check my email. </p><p>At this point, I tend to take note of what’s in my inbox, but I neither process it, nor respond to it. I want to let the coffee take hold. </p><p>I also take a quick look at my calendar and my to-do list to make sure I know what’s on deck for the day. </p><h2 id="Daily-must-reads-with-Pocket"><a href="#Daily-must-reads-with-Pocket" class="headerlink" title="Daily must-reads with Pocket"></a>Daily must-reads with Pocket</h2><p>Next up, I hit my daily most-reads. Of course, this starts with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/"><em>ZDNet</em></a>, then usually <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/"><em>Drudge</em></a>and <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/"><em>Techmeme</em></a>. I do a quick headline scan and anything that seems worth reading, I right-click and save to <a class="link"   href="http://getpocket.com/" >Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. </p><p>Some of my reads for later today.</p><p>Before I used Pocket, I used to open all the interesting headlines as new tabs. My browser was often overwhelmed with browser tabs, sometimes to the point of crashing. If I switched computers, I had to try to figure out what tabs I had open, and otherwise somehow coordinate 10-50 open tabs. It was a mess. </p><p>Now, I just save everything into Pocket, for later review. I actually do this in two phases. I use <em>ZDNet</em>, <em>Drudge</em>, and <em>Techmeme</em> as a quick way to find out what the big news of the day is. Later in the morning, I’ll open up <a class="link"   href="http://feedly.com/" >Feedly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and tackle as many sites as I feel I have time for, from my big list of feeds. Or, I might dig into a story that’s interesting and trending, and look for more content, which I’ll also save into Pocket. </p><p>The nice part about this is I can easily do this while drinking coffee. I can get a feel for the day from the headlines, but I don’t need to have all my brain cells online quite so early. Then I go and make my oatmeal. I now eat oatmeal for breakfast every day. Why didn’t I do this when I was younger. It’s <em>so</em> good for you.</p><p>By this point, I’m somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes into my day, I’ve had one or two cups of coffee, and I have a pretty solid feel for both what’s going on in my own various domains as well as what’s going on in the rest of the world. It’s a very good, very quick way to come up to speed while waking up.</p><p>Depending on the importance and urgency of the messages in my Gmail inbox, I’ll either go straight into my morning email cycle or begin my morning reading. I prefer to do morning reading before email, so I’ll discuss that next. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wy0uYNNdMDM?si=5ir7EHlr0CkpcYOT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Pocket-read-post-archive-cycle"><a href="#The-Pocket-read-post-archive-cycle" class="headerlink" title="The Pocket-read-post-archive cycle"></a>The Pocket-read-post-archive cycle</h2><p>I read. A lot. I need to keep up to date on a tremendous amount of information, both breaking news related and deep technical or academic information. As a result, a good percentage of my morning is spent reading. I also watch a lot of YouTube videos. I’m almost always learning about new stuff, and many YouTube videos provide great introductions to both how those things work and what they do. Without YouTube, I never would have <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hands-on-building-the-next-generation-x-carve-cnc-build-log/" >gotten my CNC up and running <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and done <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-first-big-cnc-project-a-parts-organizer-rack/" >my first successful build <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Because I’ve already selected the articles from my top sources, I can open up Pocket and start reading. I like this a lot, because I now have all my content in one location. </p><p>What’s particularly nice about Pocket is that it runs on not only my couch-side web browser and on Chrome, but there are versions of Pocket for iOS and Android. As a result, I can read articles anywhere – even in the <em>necessarium</em> or when I’m out and about. </p><p>Part of my morning flow is posting to the social networks. Unfortunately, this has changed. It used to be that whenever I found an article that was interesting in my Pocket collection, I tapped the Share icon in Pocket and then selected <a class="link"   href="http://bufferapp.com/" >Buffer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Buffer then took the article, scheduled it, and posted it to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Two clicks and I used to be able shared something interesting.</p><p>But Facebook broke that. Facebook no longer allows tools like Buffer and <a class="link"   href="https://hootsuite.com/" >Hootsuite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to to post to personal Facebook pages. I’ve spent years building up my personal Facebook page following and don’t want to start a corporate page (or orphan all my followers), so when Facebook broke auto-posting, it hurt. Now, I hand post to Twitter and then do it again on Facebook. LinkedIn gets a lot less attention, and, frankly, I post less frequently. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Featured-reviews"><a href="#Featured-reviews" class="headerlink" title="Featured reviews"></a>Featured reviews</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-thermostats-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-ecobee-or-amazon/" >One of the best smart thermostats I’ve tested is not made by Ecobee or Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-upgraded-to-the-iphone-16-plus-heres-why-its-the-model-most-people-should-buy/" >I demoed Apple’s standard iPhone 16 and didn’t envy the Pro models at all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-lenovos-windows-laptop-that-doubles-as-an-android-tablet-and-it-has-so-much-potential/" >This Lenovo laptop that transforms into an Android tablet is the most clever device I’ve tested <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-apple-watch-series-10-the-oura-ring-is-my-go-to-health-tracker-for-one-obvious-reason/" >Forget Apple Watch Series 10: The Oura Ring is my go-to health tracker for one obvious reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>Another aspect of my morning reading that’s changed is I no longer save articles to Evernote. I used to save off articles that would serve me for either projects I’m working on or general research resources. While I use <a class="link"   href="http://evernote.com/" >Evernote <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to write articles, I no longer use Evernote as my hub of everything. Pocket handles archived articles just fine. And Notion (more on that later) handles notes.</p><p>Rinse, wash, repeat. </p><p>I’m relatively holistic about my morning reading process. I do it until I’m bored or hungry, or feel like switching gears and moving on to managing my email and schedule. </p><p>The key point to all of this is that ever since I moved to this Pocket-read-post-archive cycle for my daily reading, my productivity and flexibility has gone up tremendously. I’m getting more done, and the quality of the process is far more pleasant. I’m no longer tied to my desktop browser, because all of these tools work on all my devices. </p><h2 id="Connecting-and-scheduling"><a href="#Connecting-and-scheduling" class="headerlink" title="Connecting and scheduling"></a>Connecting and scheduling</h2><p>Assuming there’s nothing on fire that I’ve had to handle first thing, at some point during the morning, I’ll switch from reading to communicating. I’ll switch out of Pocket and into Gmail and work my way through my email. </p><p>Gmail does a great job of filtering out spam, but I’ll go through the Updates and Promotions tabs and delete or mark-as-spam anything that’s not necessary. This is usually a pretty fast cleanup. </p><p>Sometimes, there’s something in my Updates section that indicates there’s an action item. For example, if one of my websites has pushed out a security warning, depending on the severity I’ll either go right to work fixing the problem or sending the email to Todoist as a to-do item. </p><p>This is where the integration of <a class="link"   href="https://todoist.com/" >Todoist <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Gmail is so nice. All I need to do is tap the Todoist icon, and I can turn the email message into a to-do item, complete with a link back to the original email message. Once I’ve scheduled it as a to-do item (either for that day or a later date), I can then archive the message and it’s out of my inbox. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-do-vs-google-tasks-the-best-list-manager-app-for-you/"><strong>Microsoft To Do vs Google Tasks: The best list manager app for you</strong></a></p><p>I use the same process for the rest of my email. If I can reply immediately to a query from someone mailing me, I do. If not (for example, if it will require additional research or it’s really an action item disguised as an email message), I’ll send it over to Todoist as a to-do item and clear it out of my inbox. </p><p>I do the same with calendar-related items. For example, I’m on the Information Systems and Management Certificate Advisory Board at the UC Berkeley extension, and when I get an email that there’s a scheduled meeting, I can right-click on the date right in the middle of the email message and schedule it to the calendar. Once again, the original email is available as a link, so I can remove it from my inbox and archive it. </p><p>In this way, I can power through my inbox, responding, assigning to to-do items, or to calendar. Within a very short time, I have my inbox cleared. </p><p>Now, to be fair, I have a slight email fetish, so I do check back in to my inbox, once or twice (or 20 or 30 times) a day. But now that my inbox is generally clean and empty, that practice doesn’t have much to grab onto, and it’s only a waste of a second or two. </p><p>In fact, now that I have email notifications integrated into my watch, I’m finding I’m actually breaking myself of the habit, because unless I hear the notification tone, I don’t have any important emails coming in. I have actually gone a few hours without checking my email inbox, which is something of a record for me. </p><h2 id="Managing-my-daily-teaching-opportunities"><a href="#Managing-my-daily-teaching-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Managing my daily teaching opportunities"></a>Managing my daily teaching opportunities</h2><p>As it turns out, supporting users is a lot like teaching online students.</p><p>Some years ago, I adopted a bunch of WordPress plugins as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-code-how-to-think-about-side-projects/" >a side-project that helps me keep my coding skills sharp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the (unexpected) side-effects of that is that I now have users to support. Yep, even free plugins require some amount of support time.</p><p>The way I manage this is I’ve added a support ticketing system to my lab notes website. I use a cloud service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.helpscout.com/" >Help Scout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Users post their questions and I get an email notification. All the details for each users’ situation is kept in one thread on the site, so when I go back to the conversation days or weeks later, I can see what previously transpired, all in one place. </p><p>Help Scout also has great team features, but I’m a programming army of one.</p><p>I just think of those users like more of my students. If any questions show up in my inbox, I go into the ticketing system and answer questions. I’m not assigning users letter grades, but otherwise the process is pretty much the same. </p><p>By the way, this is also a great way to think about users, which I initially was a bit unhappy about adding to my daily workload. But the reframe is this: I’m an educator and these are more people in need of assistance while they’re learning to use these plugins. So, rather than thinking about providing user support as an added workload, I think of the users as more of my students and their questions as simply more teaching opportunities. It’s also a great way to keep up on what people are doing out there, and gives me a much more “on the street” dialog with users, which is invaluable as a tech journalist.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTQGoOOiJzs?si=zbZwflEfXgBY3qbs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/" >We’ve used every iPhone 16 model and here’s our best buying advice for 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/20-years-later-real-time-linux-makes-it-to-the-kernel-really/" >20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-biggest-regret-with-upgrading-my-iphone-to-ios-18-and-im-not-alone/" >My biggest regret with upgrading my iPhone to iOS 18 (and I’m not alone) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-a-programming-job-learn-these-three-languages/" >Want a programming job?

My email has been processed and actions have been moved to my to-do list and schedule items to my calendar. I’ve done a considerable amount of reading, and I’m up to speed on the various issues I’m responsible for following. I’ve graded students and supported users (and added any bugs or key follow-up items to my to-do list). </p><p>Now, it’s time to tackle the to-do items. Like Pocket and Gmail, Todoist runs on my phone, my tablets, and on my desktop in a browser window. It even runs on my Apple Watch. So I can organize and manage my to-do items from anywhere. </p><p>The very first thing I do is go down the list and move items around. Some items are no longer a today priority, while some have increased in priority. I have some repeating tasks (like grading students for each of my sections) that pop up when they need to. </p><p>Before I go on to the rest of my day, which is doing my to-do tasks and slowly migrating into project time, I’ll tell you my newest secret weapon for managing to-do items: <a class="link"   href="https://notion.so/" >Notion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. I used to use <a class="link"   href="https://trello.com/" >Trello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do this, but hit a couple of walls. Notion, which is a bit new and a bit weird, has a whole pile of possibilities. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/notion-app-review/"><strong>Notion app review: Why (and how) I rely on this powerful productivity tool</strong></a></p><p>Notion solves a classic to-do list problem: Too many items on the to-do lists. We all suffer from this practice, where anything that might have to be done, even someday items and “I’ll get to it when I can” items, future project ideas, and all the rest all wind up on the to-do list as low-priority items that fill the list to the brim. </p><p>Some days are spent merely taking all those items that were previously scheduled for the, say, 15th of next month, and moving them to the following month once again. </p><p>I gave this problem a lot of thought and realized there are items I need to do, that are actionable in the near term, and items that just need to be on a list somewhere, that have no specific priority. </p><p>Managing projects in Notion</p><p>Notion is a combination whiteboard, list manager, project manager, app engine, and database. It’s actually quite odd and quite wonderful. It takes a while to get your arms around all it can do, but once you do, it’s incredibly helpful. Unfortunately, it’s got a silly name, a relatively uninspiring icon and marketing site, so I worry about its survivability. That said, it does have some serious funding behind it, so I’m hoping for the best.</p><p>You can create boards of certain categories, and inside those boards, you can make lists. Each list item is a card on a board, and you can write notes and interact with other members of a team on the back of each card. It sounds complex, but it’s amazingly intuitive. </p><p>Notion is also available on Android and iOS as well as web platforms, so once again, I can work on my work from anywhere. </p><p>I’ve set up a bunch of Notion pages and all the items that “should be on the list” but aren’t actionable this week or next go onto a Notion. I regularly dig into those pages, particularly when I’m working on a corresponding project, and pull items from the page and assign them to Todoist – but only if I intend to work on them right away, that week. </p><p>That, by the way, is the entire key to keeping your to-do list under control. If you actually intend to do an item within a reasonably short period of time, put it on your to-do list. If you expect to do it someday, it’s not a to-do list item, not an actionable item, and you should write them on another list somewhere. I use Trello for that. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-3d-printer/" >The best 3D printers If you’re in the market for a 3D printer, you’ll find one here that fits your needs.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>I’ve also set up Notion pages for each 3D printer, and for managing and tracking my reviews and video projects. It’s great as a catch-all for lots of details, but unlike previous catch-alls like Evernote, Notion allows you to assign some structure and layout to the stuff you’re working with. </p><h2 id="Blocking-out-time-for-my-projects"><a href="#Blocking-out-time-for-my-projects" class="headerlink" title="Blocking out time for my projects"></a>Blocking out time for my projects</h2><p>I use Notion for managing the details of my projects, but I visualize them using Google Calendar. I have three special calendars I set up: DG Planner, Planner Tentative, and Project Due.</p><p>I turned off my regular appointments so you can see how I block out chunks of time. This is a busy month.</p><p>I start with Project Due. Each deadline is placed on the calendar in a full-day appointment. Those deadlines are displayed in red, so I can’t miss them. These calendar items represent the day I need to turn in a deliverable of one kind or another.</p><p>Next is DG Planner. I use this to block out a set of days for everything that has a Project Due entry. If a project will take me four days, I use four full-day appointments. If three days, I use three, and so on. This way, I can see how busy I’ll get, and I can make sure I don’t double or triple-book any of my busiest production times.</p><p>Finally, there’s Planner Tentative. This is where I block out the approximate time a project I may or may not be working on will probably take. That way, if I’m taking with my team about a bunch of projects, I can block out some tentative time and see how my month is shaping up.</p><p>With this system, I rarely lose track of projects and also rarely overbook myself. It’s worked quite well for a bunch of years now.</p><h2 id="Rethinking-your-flow"><a href="#Rethinking-your-flow" class="headerlink" title="Rethinking your flow"></a>Rethinking your flow</h2><p>Every few years, I rethink my productivity flow, usually when I find myself getting too far behind, or getting that <em>baaaad</em> feeling that I’m letting things slip through the cracks. This latest optimization, where I added Notion, has been working for a few months now, and so far it’s the most effective flow I’ve used. Most of the elements, particularly how I use Gmail and Pocket, have been productive processes for years. </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, your flow will be different, but I strongly recommend you think about your work processes and optimize your daily activities. You’ll find you’re more effective and also that your days are more pleasant. </p><p>That’s pretty much a nice win-win, isn’t it? </p><p>P.S. Surprisingly enough, there’s no Microsoft software in my daily tools, still. Used to be, I lived in Outlook. I still use PowerPoint heavily for presentations, but my daily productivity is now completely non-Microsoft. That wasn’t a political decision or statement. I rather like Microsoft. I just looked for and found the best tools for doing my job. If I were at Microsoft, I’d think long and hard about that. </p><hr><p><em>You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

In fact, its ample range of sports and activity tracking features pretty much guarantee it’s going to be put in situations where a dropped barbell, incoming fastball, or even just a simple tumble could spell disaster for its display. Peripheral makers realized this before the first Apple Watch models ever reached consumers, and immediately began churning out solutions to protect against these very expensive accidents. </p><p>Ranging from simple films to complete, watertight cases, these products can completely deflect a blow that might have cracked or chipped a screen or, at worst, take the hit for their companion Apple Watch and be replaced far more cheaply than it could. </p><p>This list provides a cross-section of some of the best options currently available. Whether you’re shopping for a stealthy, but protective screen film, or a ruggedized, no-holds-barred full enclosure, we’ve selected the best options for keeping your pricey smartwatch nice and safe, no matter what traumas you may subject it to. </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37CV3C?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4fc25abb-becb-42dc-9547-b9387f75c71b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case"><a href="#Catalyst-Protective-Waterproof-Case" class="headerlink" title="Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case"></a>Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case</h2><h3 id="Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#Best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple Watch screen protector"></a>Best Apple Watch screen protector</h3><p>It may seem a bit odd that one of the most ruggedized Apple Watch screen protectors on this list doesn’t actually cover the device’s display. Instead, it surrounds it with one of the beefiest enclosures we were able to find, including raised bezels that greatly reduce the chance of anything impacting the display. </p><p>The Catalyst Waterproof Case is also one of the few options that even enclose the smartwatch’s Digital Crown, providing a water-tight seal that Catalyst claims can essentially double the unit’s 164-foot of water resistance to 330 feet. </p><p>This is, however, an option that is really only for those that expect to be wearing their Apple Watch in the most extreme conditions. As such, it does come with some sacrifices, including a lack of ECG support due to encasing the necessary buttons, and a permanent band that does not officially support being replaced. </p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Raised bezels to protect display</li><li>Full enclosure, including Digital Crown</li><li>Waterproof to 330 feet</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Blocks ECG Sensor</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 3,4,5,6, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HSS4KYJ?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4fc25abb-becb-42dc-9547-b9387f75c71b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector"><a href="#Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protector" class="headerlink" title="Spigen Rugged Armor Protector"></a>Spigen Rugged Armor Protector</h2><h3 id="Best-affordable-full-enclosure"><a href="#Best-affordable-full-enclosure" class="headerlink" title="Best affordable full enclosure"></a>Best affordable full enclosure</h3><p>Spigen is a brand that should be well known to most people that have shopped for a smartphone case in the past decade. Their affordable and varied enclosures tend to sit at the top of Amazon review metrics and consistently provide solid, affordable protection for the devices installed in them.</p><p>This entry into the company’s offerings attempts to find a balance between a ruggedized, full enclosure and unrestricted access to all functions of the Apple Watch. This includes leaving the Digital Crown bare to maintain ECG functionality for models that support it, and using a thin backplate that doesn’t interfere with the official Apple Watch charger. </p><p>Although most are unlikely to peg this option as being fashion-forward, Spigen has attempted to cushion the potential blow to any wearer’s aesthetic by making it available in Black, Navy Blue, Olive Green, Rose Gold, and White. Certainly, it’s not the stealthiest accessory, but it provides an excellent level of protection to the wearer’s wrist-worn investment without as many compromises as the Catalyst option seen above.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li><li>Available in five colors</li><li>Raised bezels for screen protection</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Rugged looks may not play well for formal settings</li><li>No direct protection from scratching for display</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089ZRVKC4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4fc25abb-becb-42dc-9547-b9387f75c71b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover"><a href="#Smiling-Case-Overall-Protective-Hard-PC-Case-Ultra-Thin-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover"></a>Smiling Case Overall Protective Hard PC Case Ultra-Thin Cover</h2><h3 id="Best-almost-invisible-option"><a href="#Best-almost-invisible-option" class="headerlink" title="Best almost invisible option"></a>Best almost invisible option</h3><p>The Smiling Case is, as the name might suggest, one of the slew of OEM options in this product category that can be found on Amazon. However, its reviews and its rare combination of a built-in, tempered glass screen cover with a full enclosure design make it a standout among those hundreds of other options. </p><p>While a full enclosure can never be truly invisible, this protector is about as close as you can get. Using clear plastic and tempered glass, a bystander might actually miss it at a casual glance. Despite its stealth, the product still provides protection for the metal sides and display, while promising accurate and responsive pass-through of all touch commands. </p><p>The only downside for some users might be the cover’s interference with the Digital Crown and Side Button. Although it lives up to its “Ultra-Thin” monicker, it still reduces the protrusion of the crown, making it slightly harder to turn, while also adding a recess users will need to reach into to depress the Side Button. If this seems like too much inconvenience, then a full enclosure likely just isn’t the best option for you.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>Includes tempered glass screen cover</li><li>Clear shell provides no aesthetic changes</li><li>Maintains ECG functionality</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>May make use of Digital Crown and Side Button slightly more difficult</li><li>Not from a well-known brand</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apple Watch Series 4,5,6,7, and SE</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RLZP5XX?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4fc25abb-becb-42dc-9547-b9387f75c71b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LK-Screen-Protector"><a href="#LK-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="LK Screen Protector"></a>LK Screen Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlYIdWQc-jw?si=ZQ5809CbQGEar0vg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-screen-only-film"><a href="#Best-screen-only-film" class="headerlink" title="Best screen-only film"></a>Best screen-only film</h3><p>For wearers that want to protect their unit’s display, but just can’t stand the idea of covering any of the Apple Watch’s visual appeal, the LK Screen Protector is an excellent option. Made of “Self-Healing” TPU, the skin is designed to provide 99% transparency and complete retention of screen sensitivity and responsiveness.</p><p>In addition to being able to automatically remove bubbles under the film following installation, LK also promises that the film will heal any scratches the user may subject it to within 24 hours of their appearance. Even if this weren’t the case, the low cost for a large multi-pack means that replacing the screen protector barely costs more than one dollar. </p><p>Of course, films like this and the SuperShields option below will protect from scratches, and may help to ward off minor impacts. But, they will do little to prevent damage from severe blows. For owners expecting that type of abuse, we suggest one of the sturdier, albeit far more noticeable options towards the top of this list.</p><p>Pros: </p><ul><li>TPU material rejects bubbles and “heals” scratches within 24 hours</li><li>Easy application with included kit</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>No protection for edges and little protection from severe impacts</li><li>Edge of protector may be noticeable to sensitive fingers while using touchscreen.</li></ul><p>Supported models: Apple Watch Series 6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><p>Show less </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J2C53CC?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C4fc25abb-becb-42dc-9547-b9387f75c71b%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector"><a href="#IQ-Shield-Matte-Screen-Protector" class="headerlink" title="IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector"></a>IQ Shield Matte Screen Protector</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlICvacgJY?si=jNeijBVj7ia4ammA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Best-anti-glare-film"><a href="#Best-anti-glare-film" class="headerlink" title="Best anti-glare film"></a>Best anti-glare film</h3><p>The IQ Shield option shown here addresses an issue that no other entry on this list does: glare. Anyone that’s struggled to see what their Apple Watch was trying to tell them while outdoors or directly under a harsh overhead light should appreciate the possibility of having those bothersome reflections reduced or eliminated by the matte finish on the IQ Shield Screen Protector. </p><p>IQ Shield is also somewhat unique in designing its flexible film to fit right up against the curved edges of the Apple Watch display, something many manufacturers skip in favor of a smaller, rectangular film with visible edges. This “precise fitment” not only improves the appearance of the protector, but also helps eliminate the annoying sensation of running over the edge of a screen protector when using the Apple Watch touchscreen.</p><p>Like most matte-finish films, the IQ Shield version does have some minimal impact on things like screen brightness and color accuracy. However, the benefit of not having to fight bright outside lights, especially when trying to view the somewhat dimmer displays on older Apple Watch models, will likely be more than enough to make up for any modest impact on image quality.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Matte finish blocks glare</li><li>Designed specifically to wrap around screen edges</li><li>Inexpensive multi-pack options</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Could slightly impact screen clarity or color accuracy</li><li>Won’t protect from severe impacts</li></ul><p>Supported Models: Apples Watch Series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and SE.</p><p>Show Expert Take Show less </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hsPbiic0O8?si=58mZ2Cu6wicQfsUP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors"><a href="#How-did-we-choose-these-screen-protectors" class="headerlink" title="How did we choose these screen protectors?"></a>How did we choose these screen protectors?</h2><p>The range of abuses an Apple Watch could see in its life is as varied and diverse as the user base it serves. Because of these, we’ve chosen a range of products for an assorted clientele. We feel each of these offerings is the best of the best in their particular slot of this product category. That said, it would be silly to compare a ruggedized, complete enclosure to a simple screen film. Obviously the former offers the most protection, but the latter may be preferable for users unwilling to accept any aesthetic sacrifices in the name of safety and protection for their Apple Watch. This is why each of these options includes a note or two about their ideal user, and where that user’s priorities may lie on the spectrums of form over function and protection versus visibility. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Apple-Watch-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?"></a>What is the best Apple Watch screen protector?</h2><p>The best Apple Watch screen protector is the Catalyst Protective Waterproof Case, because it is waterproof, extremely durable, and well designed.</p><h2 id="Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector"><a href="#Do-I-really-need-a-screen-protector" class="headerlink" title="Do I really need a screen protector?"></a>Do I really need a screen protector?</h2><p> This is, of course, a personal decision. For some, even the most inexpensive Apple Watch can be a major investment, well worth protecting. For others, the idea of damaging their watch’s hardy Ion-X glass may be unlikely enough, or inconsequential enough that they would prefer to just take the risk and pay for repairs, if needed. Ultimately, it’s a matter of budgeting for the cost of potential future repairs versus the definite cost and possible aesthetic blow resulting from adding some form of screen protector.</p><h2 id="What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch"><a href="#What-if-I-have-AppleCare-for-my-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?"></a>What if I have AppleCare+ for my Apple Watch?</h2><p>Apple’s well-known AppleCare+ program has saved many a device from an early grave. However, it’s important to understand the AppleCare+ policy on “accidental damage,” which any cracking or chipping of the display would fall under. According to Apple, each Watch owner qualifies for up to 2 accidental repairs per year. While this seems generous enough for all but the clumsiest owners, it also comes with a $69 fee for each of these repairs. That’s in addition to the initial $79 cost of the extended warranty. Any repeat offender maxing out their yearly repair allowance is going to very quickly rack up quite a bill for screen replacements, and may want to consider just adding a screen protector instead.</p><h2 id="Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty"><a href="#Will-a-screen-protector-void-my-warranty" class="headerlink" title="Will a screen protector void my warranty?"></a>Will a screen protector void my warranty?</h2><p>The short answer: no. Most screen protectors of any decent quality can easily be removed without leaving any sign that they were ever present. Since it’s always a good idea to remove any aftermarket accessories from any electronic device before bringing it in for service, Apple will likely never know the screen protector existed, and wouldn’t much care, even if it did. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zgwn5kVI5V4?si=1j6j4OuSSndFieXU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you"><a href="#Which-screen-protector-is-right-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Which screen protector is right for you?"></a>Which screen protector is right for you?</h2><p>The selections here were chosen to represent the full spectrum of options available. The most important thing in determining where your priorities fall within this range of products is deciding whether aesthetics are more important than protection, or vice-versa. The fashion-conscious among us probably wouldn’t be caught dead in some of the ruggedized options near the top of the list, while the extreme athletes out there might chuckle at the relatively meager protection offered by a simple screen film. You have to decide how much of an aesthetic sacrifice you’re willing to make in the name of protecting your Apple Watch.</p><h4 id="ZDNET-Recommends-1"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends-1" class="headerlink"
