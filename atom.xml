After all, they bring to mind images of sprawling data centers, with endless rows of servers and other networking gear lined up like a robot army, and there’s certainly no doubt that organizations with that kind of equipment need a way to keep it all properly and efficiently organized and managed.</p><p> However, even small businesses can benefit from a server rack to keep their equipment organized and uncluttered while ensuring its safety and security. A good network server rack or enclosure will provide enough room for the equipment that you need while keeping both your gear and the accompanying cables out of harm’s way, and they’re not just for dedicated server rooms either; in fact, if you have your servers and network equipment in a shared space like a supply room or utility closet, a good server rack or enclosure can be even more critical. We can’t count the stories we’ve heard where a delivery person or office worker has brought down an entire company’s network by tripping over a cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Size-and-Type-of-Equipment"><a href="#Size-and-Type-of-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Size and Type of Equipment"></a><strong>Size and Type of Equipment</strong></h3><p> The first and most obvious thing you’ll want to consider is how much you want to put into your rack, not just now but into the future.</p><p> Server racks are usually measured in “rack units,” representing the standard sizes of rack-mountable equipment. Very thin “pizza-box” servers and network switches are usually one unit each, while larger servers and hard disk arrays could take up three, five, or more units. These are expressed with a number followed by the letter “U,” so a “42U” rack can handle 42 rack units of equipment.</p><p> 42U is the standard size server rack used by most larger organizations—it works out to around 6 feet in height—and is, therefore, the most common. However, it’s possible to get racks and enclosures in slightly larger sizes—up to 45U—and much smaller sizes, going down to 6U for a small unit that could be used in shared spaces like utility closets. Remember that you should not only plan for future expansion but also leave some room between some of your equipment for cooling purposes, especially if you’re not putting it into a specially climate-controlled equipment room.</p><p> However, the “U” measurement only covers the_height_ of the rack, and it’s also important to consider how much_depth_ you’ll need based on what you’re going to put into it. A shallow enclosure offering around 13 to 17 inches of depth will be pleasing if it’s only for network switches and telecom equipment. Most server equipment runs deep—usually about 40 inches—and you’ll need a four-post rack to support the back end.</p><p> Note that the maximum depth of the rack doesn’t matter for most lighter equipment like network switches since these typically only need to be supported by the front posts. Racks with only two mounting posts are often used where only network switches and telecom devices need to be installed.</p><p> Lastly, rack_width_ is standard, with almost all server and network equipment racks at 19 inches wide. Whether you’re mounting larger servers or network switches, if they’re rack-mountable, they’ll all come in the same width.</p><h3 id="Rails"><a href="#Rails" class="headerlink" title="Rails"></a><strong>Rails</strong></h3><p> Many rack-mountable servers offer the option to be mounted using rails. In this configuration, a pair of standard rails are mounted to the rack, screwed into all four posts, and then the server, which has the corresponding rails mounted on the sides, slides into the rack, just like a drawer going into a cabinet.</p><p> This provides additional server stability and lets you mix and match servers of different depths since the rails always run the full rack depth. Some professionals prefer to use rails for everything in their racks, including smaller and lighter network switches, but rails are usually only necessary for heavier equipment like servers.</p><p> Using rails also allows you to efficiently access your servers for maintenance and upgrades simply by sliding them out like a drawer, which is especially important when you have more than two or three servers in a rack since it’s much more of a hassle to have to unmount a server completely when all you need to do is upgrade some RAM or change a hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6x-gscBbM80wErSJGlLp98lz_Ys=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-1082815270-5a4cd9fb94c04dfd96fadbb026d84463.jpg"                      alt="Cables connected to an internet server"                ></p><p> Alextov via Getty Images</p><h3 id="Installation-Location"><a href="#Installation-Location" class="headerlink" title="Installation Location"></a><strong>Installation Location</strong></h3><p> Where you plan to install your rack will also impact what kind of rack you choose and may even limit your choices. You’ll not likely be picking up a full-sized 42U rack if you only have a cubbyhole available, and you may not want an open rack if you’re installing it in an area that’s more highly trafficked, like a photocopier room or supply room.</p><p> Most racks can also be secured to a wall or floor for added stability, which you should consider doing, especially with taller racks. Still, on the other hand, if you have the space and a relatively isolated area, some racks offer support for wheels to allow you to move them around your server room when necessary.</p><h3 id="Cooling-Options"><a href="#Cooling-Options" class="headerlink" title="Cooling Options"></a><strong>Cooling Options</strong></h3><p> In considering where your rack will be located, remember that computer equipment generates a lot of heat, and the more you have, the hotter it gets. If you have a climate-controlled server room, then an open rack will be fine, but since most small businesses can’t afford to dedicate a whole room just for networking equipment, you’ll probably need to give this a bit more thought.</p><p> Some enclosures designed for networking equipment, like switches, provide cooling fans, which can help. Still, even with this at your disposal, you’ll want to make sure that you install your rack or enclosure in a well-ventilated area, and if you’re putting a lot of equipment into it, be sure to leave some space in between. For example, if you have 26 rack units of equipment to mount, consider buying a 42U rack to space things out and allow for better airflow.</p><p> It’s also possible to buy rack-mountable fans that generally fit into a 1U space to provide additional cooling support, but you’ll still need to leave room around these for airflow.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Physical-Security"><a href="#Physical-Security" class="headerlink" title="Physical Security"></a><strong>Physical Security</strong></h3><p> While large businesses can deal with physical security at the server room door, most smaller organizations don’t have that luxury, and chances are that you’ll be installing your servers and other network equipment in a location that other people will have access to.</p><p> Since good network security is highly dependent on limiting physical access to the actual servers and network switches, if your equipment is going to be in an area that’s generally accessible to staff, you may want to consider getting a closed rack that can be locked.</p><p> Also, remember that physical security is often just as much about preventing mistakes by non-technical employees as it is about preventing attacks by malicious hackers. True story: We once visited a remote office where a well-meaning employee had turned off the server to save electricity because they never saw anybody using it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Rack-Holes-Threaded-or-Unthreaded"><a href="#Rack-Holes-Threaded-or-Unthreaded" class="headerlink" title="Rack Holes: Threaded or Unthreaded?"></a><strong>Rack Holes: Threaded or Unthreaded?</strong></h3><p> While you’d think a hole would be standardized, there are at least three types of screw holes you’ll find in modern server racks: threaded round holes, unthreaded round holes, and unthreaded square holes.</p><p> With many generic racks, you’ll choose either threaded or unthreaded holes. While threaded holes may use various thread types, 12-24 is generally the most common. Threaded racks also usually have thicker posts since they need to support the threads without risking cross-threading.</p><p> As a rule, racks with threaded holes are great for network switches, audio equipment, telecom equipment, and other devices that don’t use rails. You’ll generally screw these in directly to your rack posts, and having a threaded hole will save you the trouble of messing with nuts to hold your screws in behind the posts.</p><p> However, if you primarily use rail-mounted equipment like network servers, you’ll want to get a rack with unthreaded holes, as it’s much easier to install rails in these racks. While you may still find some with round, unthreaded holes, these have been supplanted in recent years with square holes, which are much easier to install rails into.</p><p> Don’t worry if you’re mixing and matching rail-mounted and non-rail-mounted equipment in the same rack, as you can easily snap cage nuts into square rack holes to effectively convert them into threaded holes for your equipment that doesn’t use rails. Alternatively, you could use rails to mount everything to avoid cage nuts altogether.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rc_q9ofTd5pecAGouEFQSLea2-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/server-rack-units-Maciej-Frolow-Photographers-Choice-RF-Getty-Images-56a6f9905f9b58b7d0e5ca48.jpg"                      alt="server-rack-units-Maciej-Frolow-Photographers-Choice-RF-Getty-Images.jpg"                ></p><p> © Maciej Frolow &#x2F; Photographer’s Choice RF &#x2F; Getty Images</p><h3 id="Mounting-Parts"><a href="#Mounting-Parts" class="headerlink" title="Mounting Parts"></a><strong>Mounting Parts</strong></h3><p> Not all racks are created equally regarding what comes in the box, so you’ll want to read the fine print.

Its products run the gamut from huge 45U extra-height four-post racks to smaller 12U lockable cabinets. Chances are that if there’s something you need for your server room, Navepoint offers it. Unlike OEM racks—those sold by big manufacturers like IBM, Dell, and HP—you’ll usually find Navepoint’s options are more affordable and of at least equal quality.</p><p><strong>Startech</strong></p><p> Startech is a well-known “jack-of-all-trades” Canadian company that’s been making a wealth of computer accessories since the mid-eighties, ranging from cables to docking stations, USB hubs, mounts, video adapters, and pretty much every other accessory you could imagine needing for your computer system.

A single rack unit has a height of 1.75 inches, representing the height of a typical switch, router, or slim “pizza box” server. A standard-sized 42U server rack is 73.5 inches in height (42 x 1.75), and different servers and other rack-mountable equipment should also list their size in rack units so you can quickly tell how much space each one will take up. For example, a 3U server will take up three 42 units on a standard rack.</li><li>What size server rack do I need?<br> Checking the rack unit height of your existing equipment and any other servers or routers you plan to buy will easily allow you to calculate the rack size you need. Still, as long as it’s big enough to fit in the room where you plan to install it, it’s always a good idea to go a bit larger to give you room for future expansion. There’s no harm in leaving extra space; you can even buy rack-mountable trays and storage drawers.</li><li>Should I leave space between servers in a rack?<br> While it’s always better not to pack a rack to capacity if you can avoid it, just about any modern server or router designed for rack-mounted handles ventilation through the front and back; while it’s usually not crucial in most cases to leave space above and below your equipment, you should leave enough open air behind your rack to give the hot air somewhere to go.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Here’s Your Comprehhemediation Roadmap"></a>Fixing HDCP Problems? Here’s Your Comprehhemediation Roadmap</h2><p> High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is an anti-piracy protocol that some <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> devices honor. It’s a cable standard that’s put into place to prevent piracy. It can, however, interrupt signals even in otherwise innocuous situations.</p><p> For example, hook up a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-chromecast-2438213" >Chromecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Amazon Fire TV to an HDTV that is too old to follow the standard that these new HDMI devices are a part of. Since there’s a device in the way that is not HDCP compliant, you might get an error like:</p><ul><li>ERROR: NON-HDCP OUTPUT</li><li>HDCP ERROR</li></ul><p> However, given the way the HDCP standard works, you may be able to bypass this problem.</p><p> This information applies to televisions from a variety of manufacturers, including, but not limited to, those made by LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, and Vizio.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Fix-HDCP-Errors"><a href="#How-to-Fix-HDCP-Errors" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix HDCP Errors"></a>How to Fix HDCP Errors</h2><p> In general, you must either replace the hardware or use a special splitter. However, if your goal is to watch content, alternative sourcing methods might work, too.</p><ol><li><strong>Replace the hardware</strong> . The devices and cables must be HDCP compliant. If the problem is a cable or an intermediary device that you don’t use often or is cheaply replaced, then replacing the hardware solves the problem. If the problem relates to a major investment—like an old TV—then your costs correspondingly increase.</li><li><strong>Insert an HDMI splitter</strong> . A splitter that ignores HDCP requests creates a pathway that’s immune to this error. Position the splitter between the output and input device. For example, if a Chromecast can’t connect to a TV because of HDCP errors, connect the Chromecast to the input port of the splitter and run a different<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-hdmi-connection-problems-1846811" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the splitter’s output port into the TV’s HDMI slot.<br> The request for the HDCP device (the TV, Blu-ray player, or another device) is no longer transferred from the sender (in this case, the Chromecast) because the splitter stops it from moving between the devices.<br> Two HDMI splitters that work for fixing HDCP errors are the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004F9LVXC/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=3276299%7Cn087a41418d434401bce0afdd69178dbe01%7C" >ViewHD 2 Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Mini Splitter (VHD-1X2MN3D) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0089DSLMY/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=3276299%7Cn087a41418d434401bce0afdd69178dbe01%7C" >CKITZE BG-520 HDMI 1x2 3D splitter 2 ports switches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li><strong>Use an alternative setup</strong> .

In theory, you cannot insert a recording device between the Blu-ray player or Chromecast to make an illicit copy of the content.</p><p> In other words, if one device or cable isn’t HDCP compliant, you get an HDCP error. This is true for cable boxes, the Roku Streaming Stick, audio-video receivers, and other modern high-def devices or players that interface with those devices.</p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Rather than the current PS5’s two side panels, the new ones have four: The top two are glossy, while the bottom ones are the same matte finish as the current lineup.</p><p> The main reason for that change seems to be for attaching a disc drive later. The bottom panel comes off to let you install the peripheral.</p><p> The new PlayStation 5 also comes with more storage: 1TB, which is a slight bump from the original’s 825GB.</p><p> The general specs remain basically the same; the chips may just be slightly smaller to allow for the slimmer form factor.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LcAwBA_R8RGMc2UJ9cPM-tGd-LI=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/New-PS5-side-panel-27489245d8f94d12a9aa30ca3077ecd1.jpg"                      alt="The new PS5 with the side panel removed"                > </p><p>Sony</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Latest-News-About-the-PS5-Slim"><a href="#The-Latest-News-About-the-PS5-Slim" class="headerlink" title="The Latest News About the PS5 Slim"></a>The Latest News About the PS5 Slim</h2><p> You can get<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/gaming-news-4797039" > all the latest gaming news here at Lifewire <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Setting the time manually will usually take care of it. If the time is consistently off by one hour, then it’s probably because Amazon’s servers think you’re in a different time zone, or the system isn’t correctly adjusting the time for daylight savings time.</p><p> For example, if you live in an area where DST isn’t observed, the servers may be adjusting the time anyway. In that case, setting the time manually will usually fix the problem until daylight savings time comes around again.</p><p> If you find that your Kindle time is consistently wrong even after setting the time manually, then you may want to consider<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/restart-kindle-paperwhite-5222333" >restarting your Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

You will have to set your Kindle up again after a reset though, and re-download all of your books. If the time still drifts after that, you’ll need to contact Amazon for further assistance, as the Kindle probably has a hardware problem.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Does-My-Kindle-Show-Military-Time"><a href="#Why-Does-My-Kindle-Show-Military-Time" class="headerlink" title="Why Does My Kindle Show Military Time?"></a>Why Does My Kindle Show Military Time?</h2><p> If your Kindle shows the wrong time, like 13:30 or 22:50, that’s known as 24-hour or military time. There is no way to switch your Kindle between 12-hour and 24-hour time directly, as this setting is tied to the language you selected when you set the Kindle up. Some languages are set to use 12-hour time, and other languages are set to use 24 hour time.</p><p> There is a quirk in the case of Kindles that are set to the English language, in that Kindles set to use English (United Kingdom) will use 24-hour time, and Kindles set to use English (United States) will use 12-hour time. That means, if you speak English, you can force your Kindle to use either 12- or 24-hour time by setting the device to the corresponding language variation.</p><p> Here’s how to switch a Kindle Paperwhite to 12-hour time:  </p><ol><li>Tap the<strong>v</strong> icon in the top middle of the Kindle home screen.  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hoIB8ZzovOgAFwX_a64_ZAujeeg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B1.-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhitejpg-0a19439c8f3442e797a1f6f430b91ef4.jpg"                      alt="The V icon highlighted on the Kindle home screen"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>All Settings</strong> .  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bRaMB3kZlAcWlvNrYXiOx6fND5w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B2-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-7f48719c517a4ab49560f5b8f51700f4.jpg"                      alt="All Settings highlighted on Kindle"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>Language &amp; Dictionaries</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QR2aYMJTQnQ5tv2ghdXYvpEEKt8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B3-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-d64e455e000d489ab034179af893261f.jpg"                      alt="Language and Dictionaries highlighted on Kindle"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>Language</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/agMssSF7l7LaFlu2ySCj9t64Cj8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B4-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-cccb316c6c4342bebab129d7d0b92f1c.jpg"                      alt="Language highlighted on Kindle"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>English (United States)</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yJZWUsvz_K4ODy5y3JGyk94kv84=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B5-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-7d6a9e0b50c2472cbcc36717ad41aba1.jpg"                      alt="English (United Stated) highlighted on Kindle"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>OK</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gpyeDWGne_0u_6QozJU46hH4_Y0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B6-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-6da1c9ba4d704b84a24a17dd7a2d7553.jpg"                      alt="OK highlighted on Kindle"                ></li><li>Tap<strong>OK</strong> .  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6o7tz1z4HMQm3co0frGY_OYC-MA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/B7-Change-Time-on-a-Paperwhite-f8b6882ec46c4c9e9685d58cf4a7d131.jpg"                      alt="OK highlighted on Kindle"                ><br> Your Kindle will restart automatically at this point, and it may take several minutes.</li></ol><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>How do I use a Kindle Paperwhite?<br> All of your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-kindle-paperwhite-5224252" >navigation on a Kindle Paperwhite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is through touch controls.

It isn’t necessary to own a studio-grade microphone for karaoke unless you plan to make this kind of party a regular thing.</p><p> Wired microphones are the easiest to set up, so long as the cord doesn’t get in the way (for example, dancing, during performances, foot traffic). Otherwise, there are microphones that offer wireless freedom, but they can be expensive as well as take a bit more effort to set up properly.</p><p> But no matter what, always have at least two microphones available. Duets are more fun (and less terrifying) than solo performances, even if the song choice wasn’t originally meant for two people.</p><p> And in the cases where you only feature one singer at a time, the second microphone becomes a handy backup in case anything happens to the first one or if the event requires an emcee.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-karaoke-microphones-4580479" >The Best Karaoke Machines of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Set-Up-Speakers-Receiver-Amplifier"><a href="#Set-Up-Speakers-Receiver-Amplifier" class="headerlink" title="Set Up Speakers &amp; Receiver&#x2F;Amplifier"></a>Set Up Speakers &amp; Receiver&#x2F;Amplifier</h2><p> It’s not going to be much of a karaoke party without a decent sound system.

You may need to make some adjustments to the levels to get it right.</li><li>Notify your neighbors as a courtesy.</li><li>Set up a general playlist to keep the party vibe going without interruption. You can always change to a different track at any time.</li><li>Invite your friends to send special song requests before the party so that you don’t spend time searching for them.</li><li>Consider setting up teams for competitions, complete with judging and point-scoring.</li><li>Have a bunch of costumes, wigs, props, and accessories available for everyone to use.</li></ul><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What is the easiest karaoke song to sing?<br> Any song that most people know the lyrics to is ideal for karaoke since the audience will be encouraged to sing along. All-time karaoke favorites include Achy Breaky Heart (Billy Ray Cyrus), I Will Survive (Gloria Gaynor), and Brown Eyed Girl (Van Morrison).</li><li>Where did karaoke originate?<br> Karaoke bars originated in Kobe, Japan during the early 1970s. Roberto del Rosario patented the first home karaoke machine in 1983.</li><li>Can I use my Carpool Karaoke Mic at home?<br> Yes. Plug your Car Karaoke Mic into any radio speaker using an AUX cable to use it like you would in your car.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The iPhone X through the iPhone 15 models have an IP68 rating under IEC standard 60529, compared to the IP67 rating of the iPhones 7 and 8.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108039" >According to Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , iPhone 15 models, including the iPhone 15 Pro Max, are water resistant for a maximum depth of six meters (approximately 19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes.</p><p> If your iPhone is damaged–for example, if its screen is cracked–it may be less resistant to both water and dust.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-the-IP68-Rating"><a href="#What-Is-the-IP68-Rating" class="headerlink" title="What Is the IP68 Rating?"></a>What Is the IP68 Rating?</h2><p> IP stands for Ingress Protection, which defines how well the device can resist dust and liquid over time.</p><p> Most modern smartphones have a rating of IP67 or IP68. The first number after IP represents resistance against solids like dust and ranges from no rating or zero to six. The second number represents resistance against liquids and ranges from no rating or zero to nine.</p><p> The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s IP68, therefore, means it has the highest protection against dust and dirt and the second-highest rating for liquids.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://keystonecompliance.com/iec-60529/" >IEC standard 60529 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides guidelines for protection from solids and liquids to determine the IP rating. For water specifically, this compliance standard includes requirements including dripping, immersion, and direct spraying.</p><p> So, what does all of this mean? The iPhone 15 Pro Max is almost perfect when it comes to water resistance, but it can’t withstand major or prolonged exposure.  </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Precautions-to-Take-With-a-Wet-iPhone"><a href="#Precautions-to-Take-With-a-Wet-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Precautions to Take With a Wet iPhone"></a>Precautions to Take With a Wet iPhone</h2><p> Although your iPhone 15 Pro Max is highly water resistant, you should still heed the following precautions to avoid damaging the device and definitely dry the iPhone if it becomes wet:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-iphone-15-pro-max-8659956" >Turn the device off <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while it dries.</li><li>Do not open the SIM tray until the device is dry.</li><li>Don’t dry the device using a heat source, compressed air, or by inserting an object into the connectors.</li><li>Do not charge the device until it’s completely dry.</li><li>Before wireless charging, be sure to wipe the device dry.</li><li>Before charging with a cable or connecting an accessory, allow at least five hours of drying.</li></ul><p> If you<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/my-iphone-wont-charge-what-do-i-do-2000147" >try to charge your device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it senses liquid, you may see an alert such as “Liquid Detected” or “Charging Not Available.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Dry-a-Wet-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-Dry-a-Wet-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to Dry a Wet iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>How to Dry a Wet iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p> You may have heard the trick of placing your smartphone in a bag of rice to dry it; however,<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102643" >Apple advises against this <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it could damage your device.

If you’re a sports fan, paying around $110 per year to get access to such a wide swath of sporting content just might be worth it. If you’re a UFC fan, it’s almost a no-brainer.</p><p> While ESPN+ won’t fulfill all your sporting needs, with no NFL or NBA games, it’s an excellent add-on to your sporting media options.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Sign-up-for-ESPN"><a href="#How-to-Sign-up-for-ESPN" class="headerlink" title="How to Sign up for ESPN+"></a>How to Sign up for ESPN+</h2><p> Here’s a look at the ESPN+ signup process.</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://plus.espn.com/" > Open the ESPN+ website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select<strong>Subscribe to ESPN+ only</strong> , or choose<strong>Get the Disney Bundle</strong> if you also want Hulu and Disney+.  <!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a><!-- affiliate ads end --><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mqEdef0g0lscaZnQuEllwYL60Lw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/espn-plus-subscribe-ba32457216e0451a97a52825cc326903.png"                      alt="The ESPN+ home page"                ></li><li>To start the new account creation process, enter an email address into the form and press<strong>Continue</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QvhEZemzltzk92OO4i83GXMCDgE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/espn-new-account-email-63c85fb39c4a478cb09738529a5845c2.png"                      alt="A box to enter your email address to create a new ESPN account"                ><br> If you already have a Disney or ESPN account, sign in with those credentials.

It could be that they need both, plus accessories (known as peripherals) like mice, webcams, and headphones.</p><p> Laptops are great for letting kids work when they’re on a school bus, waiting for a ride, or hanging out anywhere there is a Wi-Fi connection. They don’t always have the same power and capabilities, however, that a desktop PC might. But for completing most middle- and high-school assignments, they should work just fine.</p><p> Some schools or districts provide students with Chromebooks free of charge; others don’t. On the other hand, college students are almost always expected to provide their own devices (like laptops or computers).</p><p> Depending on your child’s situation, you might need to budget this year for a new laptop or desktop computer, or you might be able to get away with adding just a few peripherals like a new mouse, webcam, or speakers.</p><p> Beware of school policies around Chromebook lending. In most cases, parents must sign releases indicating they will be responsible for anything that might happen to the device. That can put you on the hook for a spendy replacement or repair you might not be ready for. Schools do have other options they can give you, including requiring the student to keep the Chromebook at school or providing them with paper assignments instead.</p><p> The real trick is deciding what you need to buy. While it’s tempting to purchase the cheapest items, that can backfire because “inexpensive” sometimes translates into cheap materials that can’t withstand your child’s activities or the occasional tossed backpack. Less expensive devices may also lack the speed or power to do everything your student needs them to.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/editor-s-choice-the-best-tech-gifts-for-back-to-school-7692969" >Editor’s Choice: The Best Tech Gifts for Back To School <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5xqW8ViVbQNgb2VUsUblogbwFco=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(200000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Studentswithlaptopsondesksandbeanbags_skynesher_GettyImages-1456220436CROPPED-19c3059f597a4aa1b038835c96bacc75.jpg"                      alt="Students using laptops at tables and in bean bag chairs."                ></p><p>Skynesher&#x2F;Getty</p><p> For example, if your child is a STEM kid or a graphic artist, more power and storage are necessary overall. On the other hand, kids who just need to manage basic projects and complete homework on time will probably do fine with a standard Chromebook.  </p><p> As you make your purchases, consider how long the item will last with your child. Some kids are rough on technology, while others are more thoughtful and responsible; age often dictates how nice I’m willing to purchase for a specific child.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Look-for-Student-Discounts"><a href="#Look-for-Student-Discounts" class="headerlink" title="Look for Student Discounts"></a>Look for Student Discounts</h3><p> Check for discounts before you buy!

There is always the remote possibility that the Code 19 error you’re seeing was caused by some kind of fluke or temporary problem. If so, a simple reboot might fix it.</li><li>Did you install a device or make a change in Device Manager just before you noticed the error? If so, it’s very possible that the change you made caused the Code 19 error. Undo the change if possible, restart your PC, and then check again for the error.<br> Depending on the changes you made, some solutions might include:  <ul><li>Removing or reconfiguring the newly installed device  </li><li>Reversing the registry changes you made  </li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217" >Rolling back the driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the version prior to your update</li></ul></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-the-upperfilters-and-lowerfilters-registry-values-2619222" >Delete the UpperFilters and LowerFilters registry values <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . A common cause of Code 19 errors is the corruption of two registry values in the DVD&#x2F;CD-ROM Drive Class registry key.​<br> Deleting similar values in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992" >Windows Registry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> could also be the fix to an error that appears on a hardware device other than a DVD&#x2F;CD drive. The UpperFilters&#x2F;LowerFilters tutorial linked above will show you what you need to do.</li><li>Uninstall iTunes through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/control-panel-2625841" >Control Panel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188" >program uninstaller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While that might sound a little drastic, iTunes is the cause of enough Code 19 errors to make it into this troubleshooting guide.<br> If removing iTunes works, you might try<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478" >installing it again from scratch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which doesn’t always re-introduce the problem.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.nodevice.com/articles/windows/uninstall-windows-drivers" >Reinstall the drivers for the device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Uninstalling and then reinstalling the drivers for the device that’s experiencing the Code 19 error is a likely solution to this problem.​<br> Properly reinstalling a driver, as in the instructions linked above, is not the same as updating a driver. A complete driver reinstall involves removing the currently installed driver and then letting Windows install the driver over again from scratch.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214" >Update the drivers for the device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Installing the latest manufacturer supplied drivers for a device showing the Code 19 error could fix the problem. If updating the drivers solves the issue, it probably means that there was some kind of problem with the drivers that Windows was storing that you reinstalled in the previous step.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131" >Use System Restore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to revert device drivers and registry configurations back to a state previous to the error. Be sure to choose a restore point from a date and time before you know or suspect that the error first appeared.</li><li>Disable any hardware-based security on the device. Windows could report a Code 19 error on a device like an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-external-drive-2625867" >external hard drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if the drive had been previously secured with a password.</li><li>As a last resort, you might need to replace the hardware that has the Code 19 error.<br> It’s also possible that the device isn’t compatible with this version of Windows. You can check the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-windows-hardware-compatibility-list-2625914" >Windows HCL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to be sure.​</li><li>If you’ve discovered that hardware can’t be the cause of this Code 19 error, you’re left with it being a software-related issue.
